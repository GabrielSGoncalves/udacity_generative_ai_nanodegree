    "NBA playoffs": "The NBA playoffs is the annual elimination tournament of the National Basketball Association (NBA) held to determine the league champion. The four-round, best-of-seven tournament is held after the league's regular season and its preliminary postseason tournament, the NBA play-in tournament. Six teams from each of the two conferences automatically advance to the playoffs based on regular season winning percentage, while those teams finishing seven through 10 from each conference compete in the play-in tournament to determine the final two playoff seeds.\n\nFormat\nPrior to the 2020s, the NBA playoffs were widely regarded to comprise the entirety of the NBA postseason, although some sources suggested the NBA Finals should be regarded as separate. From the 2022–23 NBA season, when an expansion to the postseason implemented during the prior three seasons (including two COVID-shortened seasons) was made permanent, the NBA made it clearly known that the playoffs were to remain a four-round, best-of-seven tournament (including the Finals), and that thus qualification criteria for the playoffs and postseason are no longer identical.\nThe top six teams in both the Eastern Conference and Western Conference, ranked by winning percentage, directly advance to the playoffs. Teams ranked seventh through tenth compete in the NBA play-in tournament for the seventh and eighth seeds.\nOfficially considered separate from the NBA playoffs, the NBA play-in tournament uses a modified Page playoff format in which the seventh- and eighth-place teams play each other in a qualification game, with the winner being given the opportunity to play as the seventh seed of the playoffs. Meanwhile, the ninth- and tenth-place teams play each other in an elimination game, with the loser being eliminated and the winner playing the loser of the seven-eight game in a final game to determine who earns the eighth playoff seed.\nBoth conferences conduct the playoffs in the traditional bracket format. All rounds are best-of-seven series. Series are played in the 2–2–1–1–1 format, meaning the team with home-court advantage hosts games 1, 2, 5, and 7, while their opponent hosts games 3, 4, and 6, with games 5, 6 and 7 being played if needed. This format has been used since 2014, after NBA team owners unanimously voted to change the format of the NBA Finals from the 2–3–2 format on October 23, 2013. Once the playoffs start, the bracket is fixed; teams are never \"reseeded\", unlike in the National Football League and formerly the National Hockey League (until the wild card format introduced in the 2013–14 season), where the strongest remaining teams face the weakest teams in subsequent rounds.\n\nTiebreaker criteria\nIf two or more teams within the same conference are tied in overall winning percentage, tiebreaker criteria are used to determine final rankings.\nThe tiebreaker criteria are as follows:\n\nHead-to-head record; better record in games with the tied teams.\nDivision record; better record in games against teams in its own division (Only if the teams are in the same division).\nConference record; better record in games against teams in its own conference.\nWinning percentage against playoff teams in its own conference.\nWinning percentage against playoff teams in the opposing conference.\nPoint differential in all games.\nShould three or more teams tie, any division leaders are given higher seeds regardless of any other criteria. In addition, once any team is eliminated from a tiebreaker, the evaluation goes back to the first step for the remaining teams. Prior to 2016, this rule was also used for two-team ties, but only applied if the two teams have the same head-to-head record.\n\nHistory\nThe National Basketball Association was established in 1949 by merger of the Basketball Association of America (BAA) and National Basketball League but it recognizes the three BAA seasons as part of its own history. In all of its three years the BAA champion was finally determined in a best-of-seven series but its first two tournaments, the 1947 and 1948 BAA playoffs, were otherwise quite different from the third, which 21st-century NBA playoffs nearly match. In 1947 and 1948, the Eastern and Western Division champions were matched in a best-of-seven series following the regular season, whose winner advanced to the championship round. Meanwhile, four runners-up played best-of-three series to determine the other finalist: the two second-place teams were matched in one short series and the two third-place teams in another; the winners of those two series played another one. In 1947, the Philadelphia Warriors won the runners-up bracket and beat the Western champion Chicago Stags four games to one, which the NBA recognizes as its first championship; in 1948 Baltimore won the runners-up and beat Eastern champion Philadelphia in the final. Both tournaments generated one finalist from the Eastern and one from the Western Division, but only by chance.\nIn 1949, the third and last BAA tournament matched Eastern teams exclusively and Western teams exclusively, necessarily generating Eastern and Western playoff champions to meet in the final. At the same time, the number of playoff teams was increased from three to four from each Division; two rounds of best-of-three series were played, followed by a best-of-seven championship. The main idea was retained by the NBA. Even the 1950 tournament, following a transitional season with three divisions rather than two, initially determined one playoff champion from each division. The Central champion Minneapolis Lakers became the first league champion under the NBA name by defeating Anderson from the West in a best-of-three, with Syracuse from the East idle, and then knocking off the Syracuse Nationals in six games.\nThe 1951 through 1953 playoffs changed the division finals into a best-of-five playoff. With only nine league members in 1953–54, the NBA cut its postseason tournament field from eight teams to six (from 1954 through 1966, the period of eight to nine league members). Round robins were played in 1954, uniquely in NBA history—a three-team round robin among the three playoff teams in each division. From 1955 to 1966, the first-place team in each division was idle while its two runners-up faced played a best-of-three. Division finals were expanded to best-of-seven in 1958 and division semifinals to best-of-five in 1961.\nWith ten league members again for the 1966–67 season, eight teams were again admitted to the tournament, providing a simple three-round knockout (8-team bracket). A year later, the division semifinals were changed to best-of-seven playoff. Then, in 1975 and 1977, respectively, a fifth and sixth team were added to each Division, necessitating an additional first round of best-of-three series.\nFinally in 1984, the tournament expanded to its present 16-team, four-round knockout, and the now-complete set of first-round series was expanded to a best-of-five. In 2003 the first round was changed to also be best-of-seven.\nBeginning with the 2004 season, with the addition of the 30th NBA franchise, the Charlotte Bobcats, the NBA realigned its divisions. The result was that each conference would have three divisions of five teams each, and the winner of each division was guaranteed a top-three playoff seed. This would change slightly after the 2005–06 season; while division winners still receive automatic playoff berths, they are guaranteed a top-four seed, as described below.\n\n2006 NBA playoffs controversy\nThe playoff format in place for the 2005 and 2006 NBA playoffs created controversy and would be changed prior to the 2006–07 NBA season.\nPrior to 2004, when the NBA was aligned into two conferences with two divisions each, the division champions were guaranteed the top two seeds, and the best non-division winner was seeded third even if they had a better record than a lower-ranked division winner. Because of the NBA playoffs' preset matchups in the second round, this meant that the top two teams in a conference by regular season record cannot meet until the Conference Finals if they get there.\nAfter the NBA realigned its two conferences into three divisions each, the seeding rules remained largely unchanged. The top three seeds would now be reserved for division champions. However, this meant that if the top two teams (by record) in a conference were in the same division, the division runner-up could do no better than the fourth seed. Assuming no first-round upsets, this raised the prospect that the top two teams in the conference would face each other in the conference semifinals, instead of the conference finals. In the second year of this format, the 2005–06 NBA season, the two teams with the best records in the Western Conference (and the second- and third-best records in the entire league), the San Antonio Spurs and Dallas Mavericks of the Southwest Division, did just that. This turn of events led to the playoff format being criticized by many.\nIn August 2006, the NBA announced a rules change. Beginning in the 2006–07 season, the top four seeds in each conference would be seeded according to their win–loss totals. This assures that the team with the second-best record in the conference will receive the second seed even if it is not a division champion, thus \"guaranteeing that the top two teams in each conference cannot meet until the conference finals\".\n\nTimeline\n1947: The playoffs were instituted with a three-stage tournament, similar to the Stanley Cup playoffs of the 1930s; the two first-place teams qualified directly to one semifinal where they played each other in a best-of-7 series. Teams finishing second & third qualified for the best-of-3 quarterfinals, where the two second-placed teams were paired in one quarterfinal, as were the two third-placed teams, and the two quarterfinal winners played each other in a best-of-three semifinal. The two semifinal winners played each other in the Basketball Association of America (BAA) best-of-7 final series.\n\nThere were no byes, or idle time, for the division champions—as there would be for higher-seeded playoff teams 1955–66 and 1975–83. All six 1947 participants played their first tournament games on Wednesday, April 2; in 1948 the two Eastern runners-up (E2, E3 in the figure) were idle for a few days only because there was a three-way Western tie to break. Both winners of the runners-up bracket, Philadelphia in 1947 and Baltimore in 1948, reached the final series having played fewer tournament games than their final opponents, Chicago in 1947 and Philadelphia in 1948, had played in the best-of-7 pairings of division champions. And both winners of the runners-up bracket won the final series. The \"postseason\" actually comprised 11 games played in a span of 21 days for the 1947 Chicago Stags and 13 games in 30 days for 1948 Philadelphia Warriors, the finalists who emerged from the pairing of division champions.\n\n1949: The playoffs were reorganized to match Eastern Division teams exclusively, and Western Division teams exclusively in two halves of the bracket. Thus the BAA tournament generated a playoff champion in each Division. (So did the NBA in each of three 1950 divisions, and so it has done in each half of the league since then.) The top four teams from each of the two divisions qualified. The quarterfinals and semifinals were renamed division semifinals and division finals, respectively, and both rounds were best-of-3. Thus, any playoff team might be eliminated in two games, one home game. The best-of-7 final was unchanged.\n\n1950: The BAA was renamed as the National Basketball Association (NBA). With a three-division setup, 12 teams now qualified for the playoffs, with the top four teams from each division meeting in the best-of-3 division semifinals. The winners met in the best-of-3 division finals. With three teams remaining, the surviving team with the best regular season record qualified directly for the finals while the other two teams met in a best-of-3 NBA semifinals.\n\n1951: With the NBA reverting to a two-division setup; the division semifinals reverted to its original 1949 format with only eight teams qualifying. The division finals was extended to a best-of-5 format.\n\n1954: With only nine league members (soon to be eight), the number of playoff teams was cut down to six. The division semifinals was changed to a double round-robin format within the division, with the top three teams from each division qualifying (each team played four games). Following the round-robin games, the top two teams qualified for the best-of-three division finals, followed by the best-of-seven finals.\n\n1955: The number of playoff teams remained at six, but the initial round-robin was dropped after one year in favor of giving the first-place team in each division a bye to the best-of-five division finals. Teams which placed second and third played a best-of-three division semifinal. In 1955 the byes provided five and six extra days idle for the first-place teams.\n1958: The division finals was extended to a best-of-seven format.\n1961: The division semifinals were extended to a best-of-five format.\n\nThe 1961 to 1966 tournaments alone combined initial byes for the top seeded teams in each division with best-of-five initial series for second and third seeded teams in both divisions. The 1961 byes provided five and seven extra days idle for the first-place teams. By 1966 the schedule provided more rest for the first-round participants with byes of 11 and eight extra days idle.\n\n1967: The number of playoff teams was expanded to eight once more. The division semifinals now included the fourth-best team in each conference. The first-placed teams no longer received a bye. They were matched against the third-placed teams in the best-of-5 division semifinals, while the second-placed teams were now matched against the fourth-placed teams.\n1968: The division semifinals was extended to a best-of-seven format.\n\n1971: With an increased number of teams, the divisions were upgraded into conferences, which were then split into two divisions. Eight teams still qualified, four from each conference. Hence, the division semifinals and division finals came to be known as conference semifinals and conference finals, respectively. The top two teams in each division qualified as the Eastern Conference, comprising the Atlantic and Central divisions, while the Western Conference consisted of the Midwest and Pacific divisions. The first place team from one division would face the second place team of the other division within their conference. In the conference playoffs, a division winner always held home-court advantage over a second place team regardless of record.\n\n1973: The playoff format was modified, as only the divisional champions qualified automatically; two wild-cards were also added from each conference. Once qualification was determined, the four qualifiers were seeded 1–4 based on record; divisional position no longer mattered. The No. 1 seed then played No. 4, and No. 2 played No. 3.\n\n1975: The number of playoff teams was expanded from eight to ten. A first round was introduced which matched the fourth and fifth seeds in each conference in a best-of-3 first-round series, while the top three seeds received a bye. This is similar to the system currently used in the 2012 MLB postseason. Division winners did not automatically receive a bye to the Conference Semifinals.\n\n1977: The number of playoff teams was expanded from 10 to 12. The first round now included the sixth best team in each conference, which was matched against the third seed. Only the division winners received byes to the next round.\n\nThe 1983 tournament is the latest to incorporate first-round byes for seeded teams. The first-round best-of-three series tapped off on Tuesday and Wednesday, April 19 and 20; the second-round best-of-sevens on Sunday to the following Wednesday, April 27. Counting from Tuesday the byes provided five to eight extra days idle.\n\n1984: The playoffs were expanded from 12 teams to 16 teams. All teams now participated in the first round, which was extended to a best-of-five series.\n\n2003: The first round was extended to a best-of-seven series. This change arguably benefitted the higher seeds as it reduced the likelihood of an upset by a lower seed. It also meant that a team that swept their series 4–0 might have to wait up to two weeks to play their next series against a team that had won 4–3.\n\n2005: Each conference was realigned into three divisions with each division winner qualifying for a top-three seed regardless of record. The next best five teams from each conference also qualify for the playoffs.\n\n2007: To address the criticisms of having each division champion guaranteed a top-three seed, regardless of record, the rules were changed such that the division winners are now only guaranteed a top-four seed. The team with the second-best record in the conference is now guaranteed the second seed, even if it finishes second in its own division. This ensures that the two best teams in the conference will not meet until the conference finals at the earliest. The previous system raised the prospect of the two best teams in the conference being seeded 1 and 4 if they play in the same division, thus forcing them to play each other in the second round (given no upsets).\nNote: In the example below, both the East's No. 2 seed and the West's No. 3 seed are not division champions.\n\n2016: While the playoff bracketing did not change, qualification criteria were changed. The teams with the eight best records in each conference receive playoff berths, with no automatic berths or guaranteed top-four seed placement for division champions.\nNote: In the example below, both the East's No. 7 seed and the West's No. 5 seed are division champions.\n\n2020: Beginning in 2020, play-in games were used to determine the final qualified team(s) in the first round of the NBA playoffs.\nIn the 2020 play-in format, if the ninth-place team within a conference finished the regular season within four games of the eighth-place team, they would compete in a postseason play-in series. This format was used only in the Western Conference, as the No. 9 Memphis Grizzlies finished within a half-game of the No. 8 Portland Trail Blazers. Described as a best-of-two series, the Trail Blazers, needing only one win as the higher seed, eliminated the Grizzlies in game one to advance to the playoffs.\n\n2021: In 2021, the format for the play-in games was finalized.\nIn 2021, the top six teams in each conference advance to the playoffs, while seventh- through tenth-placed teams qualified for a play-in tournament. The seventh- and eighth-place teams got up to two chances to win one game to qualify for the playoffs, while the ninth- and tenth-place teams needed to win two consecutive games to advance. The play-in games would become a permanent part of the postseason starting in 2023.\n\nW1 is Winner of 7/8 game \nL1 is Loser of 7/8 game \nW2 is Winner of 9/10 game \nW3 is Winner of W2 / L1 game.\n\nTeam rosters\nPlayoff teams must identify their postseason rosters before the playoffs begin. They are allowed up to 15 players each and can designate two players as inactive for each game. Players are eligible to be on a team's playoff roster as long as they were on the team for at least one regular season game, and were not on another NBA team's roster after March 1. Prior to the 2005–06 season, playoff rosters were limited to 12 players who were named before the playoffs began.\n\nRecords and statistics\nOnly six eighth-seeded teams have managed to win a series versus the number 1 seeded team:\n1994 – The Denver Nuggets eliminated the Seattle SuperSonics 3–2.\n1999 – The New York Knicks eliminated the Miami Heat 3–2.\n2007 – The Golden State Warriors defeated the Dallas Mavericks 4–2 in the Western Conference First Round, becoming the first 8 seed to beat a 1 seed in the best of 7 format.\n2011 – The Memphis Grizzlies beat the San Antonio Spurs 4–2.\n2012 – The Philadelphia 76ers beat the Chicago Bulls 4–2, following a torn ACL to star Derrick Rose.\n2023 – The Miami Heat beat the Milwaukee Bucks 4–1, becoming the first eight seed to win a playoff series after qualifying for the NBA play-in tournament. The Heat finished the regular season 7th in the Eastern Conference but were relegated to the eighth seed following the play-in tournament. They are also the first team to win their division but qualify for the play-in games, having won the Southeast Division title with the worst record, and they eventually became the lowest-seed division winner in playoff history.\nThe 1998–99 Knicks and the 2022–23 Heat are the only eighth-seeded teams to reach the NBA Finals; no eighth-seeded team has won the NBA championship as of 2024. In addition, the Heat are the first team to reach the Finals after qualifying for the play-in tournament.\nSix seventh-seeded teams have beaten a number 2 seeded team:\n1987 – The Seattle SuperSonics defeated the Dallas Mavericks 3–1.\n1989 – The Golden State Warriors defeated the Utah Jazz 3–0.\n1991 – The Golden State Warriors defeated the San Antonio Spurs 3–1.\n1998 – The New York Knicks defeated the Miami Heat 3–2.\n2010 – The San Antonio Spurs defeated the Dallas Mavericks 4–2.\n2023 – The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Memphis Grizzlies 4–2.\nOf the six teams, only the 1986–87 Seattle SuperSonics and the 2022–23 Los Angeles Lakers made it as far as the Conference Finals; no seventh-seeded team has advanced to the NBA Finals.\nThe 2022–23 Miami Heat and the 2022–23 Los Angeles Lakers are the only teams to win a playoff series after qualifying for the play-in tournament. The 2023 playoffs also marked the first time two teams seeded 7th or lower won a playoff series in a single postseason, and the first time two teams seeded 7th or lower reached the Conference Finals.\nThe 1956–57 St. Louis Hawks, 1958–59 Minneapolis Lakers and the 1980–81 Houston Rockets are the only teams with losing records (34–38, 33–39 and 40–42, respectively) to make it to the NBA Finals. All three lost to the Boston Celtics. In 1981, the Houston Rockets' opponent in the Western Conference Finals, the Kansas City Kings, also had a losing record (40–42).\nThe 1994–95 Houston Rockets, a sixth seed with a record of 47–35, are the lowest-seeded team to win the NBA Finals. In the NBA Finals, the Rockets swept the Orlando Magic (57–25) in four games; in doing so, the Rockets defeated four teams that had won 50 or more games during the regular season (the Utah Jazz at 60–22, the Phoenix Suns at 59–23, the San Antonio Spurs at 62–20 and Orlando at 57–25), the first time a team had done so. As of now, the 1994–95 Rockets are the only team to have won an NBA title without having home-court advantage during any round of the playoffs.\nThe Golden State Warriors own the longest NBA playoff winning streak for a single postseason with 15 straight wins in the 2017 playoffs.\nOf all the teams with multiple NBA Finals appearances, the Chicago Bulls are the only team to have never lost in the Finals, winning six.\nThe Boston Celtics possess the most overall NBA Finals series wins with 18. The Celtics have played in 23 NBA Finals series, with an overall record of 18–5.\nThe longest active playoff appearance streak currently belongs to the Boston Celtics with 10 consecutive appearances in the playoffs, beginning in the 2014–15 NBA season. The longest streak of playoffs appearances in a row is currently tied at 22 seasons between the San Antonio Spurs, who made it from 1997–98 season until the 2018–19 season, and the Syracuse Nationals/Philadelphia 76ers, who made it from the 1949–50 season to the 1970–71 season.\nAs of the 2023–24 season, the longest active playoff drought belongs to the Charlotte Hornets, who have not made the playoffs since the 2015–16 season. The longest all-time playoff drought belongs to the Sacramento Kings, who went 16 seasons without making the playoffs (2006–07 through 2021–22).\nIn 1983, under the best of 3(bye)–7–7–7 system, the Philadelphia 76ers, who had a bye in the first round, attained the best record of 12–1, having only lost in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Milwaukee Bucks.\nIn 2001, under the best of 5–7–7–7 system, the Los Angeles Lakers attained the best record of 15–1, having only lost in Game 1 of the Finals against the Philadelphia 76ers.\nIn 2017, under the best of 7–7–7–7 system, the Golden State Warriors attained the best record of 16–1, having only lost in Game 4 of the Finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Warriors and Cavaliers came into the Finals with a combined record of 24–1, with the Cavaliers having only lost in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Boston Celtics.\nThe top four seeded teams all advanced to the Conference Semifinals round in 1980, 1986, 1997, 2002, 2004, 2008, 2019 and 2022.\nEvery seed number from 1 to 8 advanced to the Conference Semifinals round in 2023.\n\nPlayoff appearances\nCurrent as of the 2024 NBA playoffs\n\nAppearances by active teams\nAll-time NBA playoffs table\nThe all-time NBA playoffs table is an overall record of all match results of every team that has played in playoffs since the 1946–47 season.

    "1950 NBA playoffs": "The 1950 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the inaugural National Basketball Association 1949–50 season. The tournament concluded with the Central Division champion Minneapolis Lakers defeating the Eastern Division champion Syracuse Nationals 4 games to 2 in the NBA Finals.\nTwelve teams qualified for the playoffs. Including tiebreaker games that preceded two of the six first-round series, they began play on Monday to Wednesday, March 20 to 22, and the best-of-seven Finals concluded in game six on Sunday, April 23. The champions played the greatest number of games, 13 in a span of 34 days, on a schedule including both back-to-back games and as many as six days off.\n\nBracket\nThe NBA was created in 1949 by merger of  two competing professional basketball leagues, the BAA and NBL. For its first season only, the NBA teams were arranged in three divisions: Eastern, comprising the five surviving BAA Eastern Division teams plus Syracuse from the NBL; Central, comprising the five surviving BAA Western Division teams; and Western, comprising all the NBL teams except Syracuse. Within each division the top four teams were matched in two rounds of short series to generate a champion, after which the three division champions contended for the NBA title.

    "1951 NBA playoffs": "The 1951 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association 1950–51 season. The tournament concluded with the Western Division champion Rochester Royals defeating the Eastern Division champion New York Knicks 4 games to 3 in the NBA Finals.\nThe eight qualified teams began tournament play on Tuesday and Wednesday, March 20 and 21, and the Finals concluded on Saturday, April 21. Rochester and New York played 14 games in a span of 33 days; their seven final games in fifteen days.\nThe Rochester Royals (now the Sacramento Kings) were \"royalty\" in their first nine seasons, from 1945–46 to 1953–54 always one of the strong teams in their league. Rochester had played three seasons in the National Basketball League, winning the 1946 NBL championship and losing the Finals in 1947 and 1948. In one BAA and one NBA season, the team had won 75% of its games before losing in the second round, then first round, of the 1949 and 1950 playoffs. The 1950–51 team won more than 60% of its games, as the Royals would do for three more seasons, and participated in the club's only NBA Finals. That remains true more than 60 years later, covering stints in Rochester, Cincinnati, Kansas City, and Sacramento.\nThe New York Knicks were an original Basketball Association of America franchise, now in its sixth season and participating in the BAA or NBA Finals for the first time. It would be the first three consecutive years as losing finalist.\nAnother six-year-old, original BAA team, the Boston Celtics had qualified only for the 1948 BAA Playoffs.

A three-way tie with two wins each would have secured home-court advantage in the Division Finals for New York or Minneapolis, who finished first in the season standings, against an opponent to be determined by one further game played with the season runner-up as host. In the event, neither round-robin generated even a two-way tie, so no seventh game was required in either Division. Two of three teams (shaded green) advanced to the Division Finals. The second game between Minneapolis and Rochester—the sixth and final Western Division game scheduled—was not played because both teams had qualified for the Division Final and Minneapolis had secured home-court advantage in that series. The sixth and final Eastern Division game scheduled, Boston at Syracuse, was played because home-court advantage in their subsequent Division Final hadn't been determined.

He retired nine games into the season because of ongoing knee problems.\nThe Conference Semifinals series between the Bullets and Knicks would be the last NBA playoff series in which the team with the inferior regular season record held home-court advantage based on division champions holding home-court advantage over a division runner-up through the Conference Finals. Although from 1977–2015, division champions were either automatically seeded higher than non-division champions or guaranteed a minimum seed regardless of record.

Willis Reed became the first player to be named NBA Finals MVP twice.\nThe playoff format was modified, as only the divisional champions qualified automatically; two wild-cards were also added from each conference. Once qualification was determined, the four qualifiers were seeded 1–4 based on record; divisional position no longer mattered. The #1 seed then played #4, and #2 played #3. Because of this new format, New York, the Atlantic Division runner-up, had home-court advantage versus the Baltimore Bullets, the Central Division champion, since the Knicks had the better regular-season record. The Bullets had home-court advantage in the 1972 playoffs versus the Knicks and in the 1971 playoffs versus Philadelphia, even though their record was worse than New York's and Philadelphia's were those seasons, because they had won their division, while the Knicks and Sixers were runners-up.\nThis was the second straight time (and third in the last 4 years) that the Lakers and Knicks met in the Finals; the Lakers–Knicks rivalry ended with two titles won by the Knicks and one by the Lakers.\nThis was the Lakers' last appearance in the Finals until 1980; It was New York's last appearance until 1994.\n\nBracket\nConference semifinals\nEastern Conference semifinals\n(1) Boston Celtics vs. (4) Atlanta Hawks\nThis was the sixth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Celtics winning four of the first five meetings.\n\n(2) New York Knicks vs. (3) Baltimore Bullets\nLast Playoff Game played at The Baltimore Civic Center.\nThis was the fifth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Knicks winning three of the previous four meetings.\n\nWestern Conference semifinals\n(1) Milwaukee Bucks vs. (4) Golden State Warriors\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Bucks winning the first two meetings.\n\n(2) Los Angeles Lakers vs. (3) Chicago Bulls\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning the first three meetings.\n\nConference finals\nEastern Conference finals\n(1) Boston Celtics vs. (2) New York Knicks\nThe Knicks became the 1st NBA road team to win Game 7 after leading series 3–1.

Also, since the top three Western qualifiers were in the Midwest Division, the two divisional champions in the Western Conference (Milwaukee and Los Angeles) played in the conference semifinals.\nWith a 4–3 series victory over the Pistons in the first round, the Bulls earned their first playoff series victory. In their first eight years of existence, the Bulls made the playoffs seven times.\nThe Bulls–Pistons rivalry started in their conference semifinal encounter, which Chicago won, 4–3. But it wasn't until the next four meetings (1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991) that the rivalry became even more intense, particularly due to the intense battles that made both teams legitimate contenders in the East.\nAs a matter of historical curiosity, 3 of the 4 teams in the 1974 Western Conference bracket (Milwaukee, Detroit and Chicago) now reside in the Eastern Conference.\nThis was the only appearance of the Capital Bullets in the playoffs under that moniker; they assumed the \"Capital\" name for one year before changing to the Washington Bullets the next season.

The Warriors won their third NBA title and first since 1956 as the Philadelphia Warriors.\nThe playoff format was revised again, as the result of which the first two finishers in each division were guaranteed playoff berths, along with the best third-place team from each conference. Once each conference's qualifiers were selected, they were seeded 1–5, with the fourth and fifth seeds playing a best-of-three series, with the victor advancing to play the first seed in a best-of-seven semifinal, while the second and third seeds played the other semifinal.\nThe eight-year-old Seattle SuperSonics made their playoff debut, winning the first playoff series in franchise history against the Detroit Pistons. Seattle would go on to make consecutive NBA Finals appearances in 1978 and 1979, winning the championship the latter year.\nThe Kansas City-Omaha Kings made their first playoff appearance since 1967 as the Cincinnati Royals, and the Houston Rockets made their first playoff appearance since 1969 as the San Diego Rockets.\nThe 1975 playoffs expanded the number of playoff qualifiers to 10; it would be expanded again to 12 in 1977 and again to its current number of 16 in 1984.\nAt the time, this was the closest the Chicago Bulls came to an NBA title, losing to the Warriors in the Western Conference Finals 4–3. This was their second and final Western Conference Finals appearance as they would move to the Eastern Conference in 1980. They would not reach the East Finals until 1989, and would not win a title until 1991.\n\nBracket\nFirst round\nEastern Conference first round\n(4) Houston Rockets vs. (5) New York Knicks\nThis was the first playoff meeting between these two teams.\n\nWestern Conference first round\n(4) Seattle SuperSonics vs. (5) Detroit Pistons\nThis was the first playoff meeting between these two teams.\n\nConference semifinals\nEastern Conference semifinals\n(1) Boston Celtics vs. (4) Houston Rockets\nThis was the first playoff meeting between these two teams.\n\n(2) Washington Bullets vs. (3) Buffalo Braves\nThis was the first playoff meeting between these two teams.\n\nWestern Conference semifinals\n(1) Golden State Warriors vs. (4) Seattle SuperSonics\nThis was the first playoff meeting between these two teams.\n\n(2) Chicago Bulls vs. (3) Kansas City-Omaha Kings\nThis was the first playoff meeting between these two teams.\n\nConference finals\nEastern Conference finals\n(1) Boston Celtics vs. (2) Washington Bullets\nThis was the first playoff meeting between these two teams.\n\nWestern Conference finals\n(1) Golden State Warriors vs. (2) Chicago Bulls\nChet Walker's final NBA game.\nThis was the first playoff meeting between these two teams.\n\nNBA Finals: (E2) Washington Bullets vs. (W1) Golden State Warriors\nThis was the first playoff meeting between these two teams.\n\nSee also\nNBA records\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nBasketball-Reference.com's 1975 NBA Playoffs page",

They wouldn't win another playoff series until 1992.\nThis was the final playoff appearance for the Buffalo Braves franchise in Buffalo until 1992, when they returned as the Los Angeles Clippers.\nThis would prove the last Conference Finals appearance for the Golden State Warriors until 2015 under the leadership of Steph Curry.\nThe Philadelphia 76ers made the playoffs for the first time since 1971, starting a 12-season run that included four NBA Finals appearances (1977, 1980, 1982, and 1983 (winning in the latter year)).

The tournament concluded with the Western Conference champion Portland Trail Blazers defeating the Eastern Conference champion Philadelphia 76ers 4 games to 2 in the NBA Finals. It was Portland's first (and so far, only) NBA title. Bill Walton was named NBA Finals MVP.\nPortland won the NBA title in its first playoff appearance, something that had not taken place since the early days of the BAA (and has not since, as of 2022). The Trail Blazers went 10-0 at home in the playoffs.\nThis was the first NBA playoffs after the ABA-NBA merger; two of the former ABA teams (the San Antonio Spurs and Denver Nuggets) made their playoff debuts in their first NBA season. The New Jersey Nets made their playoff debut in 1979, and the Indiana Pacers in 1981.\nThe NBA Playoffs added 1 more team from each conference, for a total of 12 contestants, up from 10 the previous year. Also, the two division winners in each conference were automatically given a first-round bye and started the playoffs in the conference semifinals.\nThis was the Detroit Pistons last playoff appearance of the decade and their last as a Western Conference team, as they would move to the East in 1978. They would not reach the postseason again until 1984.\nAfter losing in the semifinals to Los Angeles, the Golden State Warriors wouldn't return to the playoffs again until 1987.\nFor the first time since 1956, the Eastern Conference Finals had neither the Celtics nor Knicks participating.\nThe referees went on strike during these playoffs.

This would be the first of two straight meetings in the Finals between the Bullets and Sonics, with Seattle winning the title the next year.\nThis was the first time since the expansion of the playoff field to 10 teams in 1975 that neither conference champion had the benefit of a first-round bye by being one of the top two teams in the conference during the regular season.

As of the 2021–22 season, this remains the last time the Bullets (now the Wizards) have advanced as far as the Conference Finals.

In the Suns' possession, Walter Davis appeared to have scored, but committed a traveling violation with 41 seconds left.  On the next play, Sonics player Gus Williams' shot came up short. Phoenix grabbed the rebound and called timeout with 16 seconds left, with a chance to clinch their 2nd NBA Finals berth. Walter Davis' high-arc shot also came up short, and the ball went out-of-bounds last touched by a Sonics' player with one second left.  The Suns' last chance, Gar Heard's potential game-winning shot, was an airball, meaning the SuperSonics forced a 7th game in Seattle on Thursday.\nWith the score 112–104 in favor of Seattle with just 20 seconds left, it appeared to be all over, but the Phoenix Suns would not quit easily. After the Suns scored 4 unanswered points, Paul Westphal stole an inbounds pass and drove to the basket for a score, getting fouled by Wally Walker. This made it a 2-point game and sent Westphal to the line with just 4 seconds left. Suns coach John MacLeod called a timeout to decide what to do on the free throw attempt. The Suns elected to intentionally miss and try to score off an offensive rebound, but the rebound went to the Sonics' Jack Sikma, who was intentionally fouled and made both free throws to give the Sonics the Western Conference for the 2nd straight year.\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Suns winning the previous meeting.\n\nNBA Finals: (E1) Washington Bullets vs. (W1) Seattle SuperSonics\nLarry Wright makes the game winning free throws with one second remaining.\n\nDennis Johnson blocks Kevin Grevey with 4 seconds left to seal it.\n\nThis was the second Finals meeting between these two teams, with the Bullets winning the first meeting.\n\nSee also\nNBA records\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nBasketball-Reference.com's 1979 NBA Playoffs page",

The Lakers earned their seventh NBA title, their second since moving from Minneapolis.\nMagic Johnson became the first and (as of 2023), only rookie to be named NBA Finals MVP, leading L.A. to a clinching Game 6 victory with 42 points, 15 rebounds and 7 assists.

    "1981 NBA playoffs": "The 1981 NBA playoffs were the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 1980–81 season. The tournament concluded with the Eastern Conference champion Boston Celtics defeating the Western Conference champion Houston Rockets 4 games to 2 in the NBA Finals. Cedric Maxwell was named NBA Finals MVP.\nThe playoffs are notable for being the third and final time to date that a team with a losing record advanced to the NBA Finals (the St. Louis Hawks did it first in 1957 with a 34–38 record, the Minneapolis Lakers did it in 1959 with a 33–39 record), as the Rockets won their first Western Conference title despite having a 40–42 record.\nThis was the only time in NBA history in which two teams with a losing record played each other in a Conference Finals, though the 1957 Western Division Finals did feature two teams with losing records. The Rockets and the Kansas City Kings, both with a 40–42 record, played in the Western Conference Finals which saw the Rockets prevail 4–1.\nThe Kings' playoff series victories over the Blazers and Suns were their last in Kansas City. Their last playoff series in Kansas City was a 3-game sweep in the first round in 1984 by the Lakers. They moved to Sacramento after the 1984–85 season and didn't win a playoff series representing northern California until 2001.\nThe Pacers became the last former ABA team to make their playoff debut, but were quickly swept by the 76ers 2–0.\nThis is the last year to date that an NBA playoff game was played in March.\nThe Celtics replicated their 1968 comeback by beating the Sixers in 7 after trailing 3–1. This is the only time a team came back from a 3–1 series deficit to win against the same team twice.\nThis was the last time the Los Angeles Lakers were not the number one seed in the Western Conference until 1991.

He completed the three-point play. Larry Bird pushed the ball up court after a Sixers turnover. He pulled up and hit a mid-range shot to make it 93–91. Then after a Dawkins miss, Bird grabbed the rebound and threw a quick outlet pass that led to a fast-break layup to tie it at 93.\nThe teams traded baskets for four straight trips before the Sixers took a 101–97 lead with 4 minutes left. They traded baskets again, with Julius Erving finishing the scoring for the 76ers with a dunk over Robert Parish and two free throws for a 107–103 lead with 2:30 left. With over a minute left, Caldwell Jones lost his shoe in a scramble and played defense with it in one hand. Nate Archibald took advantage and drove right at Jones, who allowed him a free lane for an easy lay-up to make it 107–105 (he held the shoe instead of tossing it away to have both hands free or using it to his advantage to block the shot).\nIn the final minute, Philadelphia committed a shot-clock violation, giving Boston a chance to tie or go ahead. But Parish's turn-around shot rolled out. The rebound was tipped between two Sixers players and almost went out-of-bounds before Erving got it to Maurice Cheeks with 30 seconds left. The Sixers used as much time as they could, but Bobby Jones missed a runner and Maxwell got the rebound with 7 seconds left. He passed it to Archibald, who forced a half-court pass to Bird that Bobby Jones intercepted to end the game and give Philadelphia a 3–1 series lead.\nGame 5 was back in Boston, and the Celtics were in a must-win situation. Bobby Jones' block on Gerald Henderson led to a fast-break lay-up by Andrew Toney to give the 76ers a 103–99 lead. The teams traded buckets the next four trips until a missed jumper by Bird and two Dawkins free throws made it 109–103 with 1:51 left. Dawkins got a steal, but Maxwell's game-saving block prevented a Philadelphia lay-up and led to an Archibald three-point play with 1:20 left that made it 109–106. Boston then got another block by Parish. The Sixers recovered the ball, but lost it out-of-bounds seconds later.\nBird's lay-up made it 109–108 with 47 seconds left. After a Sixers timeout, Bobby Jones' inbounds pass was deflected by Bird, then tipped by Dawkins. Bird reached for the ball while Jones put his hands up to show he didn't touch it as the ball went out-of-bounds. The referees gave the 76ers the ball, much to Bird's dismay. He argued to the refs that he didn't touch it. They met to make a decision. After a few minutes, possession was awarded to the 76ers, and Jones cleanly inbounded to Dawkins. He passed to Hollins, who gave it to Toney, who almost lost and palmed the ball, but the referees let play continue despite the jeers from the crowd. Toney tried to get the ball to Erving, but M.L. Carr deflected it out-of-bounds.\nThe last 29 seconds had a few moments that were reminiscent of earlier Boston Garden lore. Erving stood in almost the same spot where Hal Greer had his pass stolen by John Havlicek to seal the 1965 Eastern Division Finals. However, the 76ers were ahead this time. Erving inbounded the ball, but it got past Jones and started rolling along the sideline. Bird grabbed it and drove to the hoop with only Jones to stop him. He beat Bird to the hoop to challenge his floater. Carr got the rebound and missed, but a foul was called on Erving. With the season on the line and 20 seconds left, Carr hit both to give Boston a 110–109 lead.\nAfter a timeout, Lionel Hollins took the ball up court and passed to Bobby Jones, who passed it to Erving. With Maxwell defending and Bird coming to double-team, Erving passed back out to Jones. With the clock ticking away, he drove and missed a floater with 7 seconds left. Carr got the rebound and ran the clock down to 1 second before Erving fouled him. Like Game 5 of the 1976 NBA Finals, the fans and media ran onto the court thinking it was over. Once it was cleared, Carr had to shoot the free throws. He hit the first to make it 111–109, then intentionally missed the next two (the 3-to-make-2 rule). Dawkins got the rebound and called timeout. The crowd huddled around the court with 1 second left and Jones standing in nearly the same spot that Curtis Perry stood before passing the ball to Gar Heard. This time, things turned out better as Parish stole it to keep Boston alive. But the Sixers still led 3–2 and were going back home.\nIn Game 6, Philadelphia was looking to clinch at home, and it looked like they would, as they were up by 17 at one point. But with the season on the line yet again, the Celtics fought back. With the game tied at 87 late in the fourth, Erving was blocked from behind by Bird underneath the basket. On the Celtics' end of the court, Archibald missed a 15-footer, but followed his own miss and went right back up for a layup. Cheeks hit a reverse lay-up to tie it at 89. He fouled out on the next possession. Parish hit both free throws to give Boston a 91–89 lead. After Boston failed to capitalize on a Sixers turnover, Erving tied it at 91 with a layup over Parish. After Bird traveled, Dawkins was fouled and hit both free throws to give the Sixers a 93–91 lead. This was short-lived, as Parish hit a baseline jumper and drew the foul. He completed the 3-point play to give Boston a 94–93 lead with under 3 minutes left.\nA Dawkins dunk and two Archibald free throws further swayed the lead. A Hollins miss gave Boston a chance to build the lead, but Parish left after being called for an offensive foul, his sixth. That brought in rookie Kevin McHale to guard Dawkins. The Sixers went right at him, but he played good defense and forced Dawkins to miss. Bird hit an 18-footer to give Boston a 98–95 lead with 1 minute left. Toney answered by hitting a 20-footer with 54 seconds and stealing the ball from Bird with 29 seconds left and the Sixers down 1. He went for the lead, but McHale blocked it and got the ball with 14 seconds left. He passed the ball ahead to Archibald and Boston played keep away. The Sixers didn't foul until 2 seconds left. Maxwell made both foul shots to give Boston a 100–97 lead. After a timeout, the Sixers inbounded at midcourt.\nThe first attempt was deflected out-of-bounds by Bird, but 2 seconds still showed on the clock. However, it moved the position of the inbounds pass upcourt, making Billy Cunningham decide to take their final timeout to draw up a play from the new position. McHale's defense prevented Jones from inbounding to Toney in the corner, but he found Dr. J at the top of the key, who was immediately fouled by Archibald to prevent him from handling the ball cleanly to even try to shoot a 3. So with 1 second left, Erving had two foul shots while down 3. The Sixers still had a chance if he made the first and missed the second. He missed the first. Erving hit the second to make it 100–98. After a timeout, the Celtics inbounded from midcourt and tied the series at 3 heading back home for Game 7.\nLike the last three games, Game 7 came down to the wire. It finally looked like the 76ers' night as they led by 7 with 4:34 left. Maxwell and Archibald brought Boston within 4 from the line. A Parish steal and a turn-around jumper cut it to 2. Parish blocked Dawkins' lay-up, which led to a fast-break, but Maxwell lost his balance and traveled. \"Tiny\" Archibald got a steal leading to a Bird dunk attempt that missed, but was fouled by Erving; his fifth. Bird missed the first, but made the next two to tie it at 89 with 2:51 left.\nThe 76ers' next trip downcourt was a wild one. Dr. J almost traveled, a pass got deflected out of bounds, Caldwell Jones got the offensive rebound off a Dr. J miss, and a Bird block on Erving, led to a scramble for the ball that saw bodies fly all over the court. It eventually rolled to Hollins, who got it off before the shot clock expired, but missed. A battle for the rebound almost saw Bird tip it out-of-bounds, but as the ball bounced precariously near the baseline, he grabbed it and got it to \"Tiny\" to give Boston a chance to take the lead.\nOn Boston's possession, Parish threw up an airball that went out-of-bounds off Hollins, giving the Celtics a second chance. However, \"Tiny\" missed a long-range 2, and the rebound bounced off Boston. The Sixers then put the ball in the hands of Erving and Dawkins as they traded the ball back and forth to wear down the Celtics defense. Parish, Maxwell, and Bird played tough defense, and forced a Dawkins miss that Bird rebounded. He led the fast-break himself and hit a mid-range bank shot to give Boston a 91–89 lead with 1:03 left.\nWith the 76ers looking to tie or go ahead, Erving's pass was stolen by Carr with 47 seconds left. But Boston was without Archibald, who got injured a couple plays back. Henderson had the ball poked away by Hollins to Cheeks, who kept it on the fast-break. He drove to the basket and got fouled hard on a missed lay-up. He took a few moments to get up. He gutted it out though, and went to the line with a chance to tie it with 29 seconds left. He split the pair to make it 91–90.\nThe 76ers chose not to foul and played tough defense. Boston used up the entire shot-clock before Carr finally took a shot with 7 seconds. He missed, but Parish momentarily had a series-ending offensive rebound, but lost it. Bobby Jones finally got the rebound and called time with 1 second left. So with a chance to win, he had to inbound the ball with fans, security, and media huddled around the court. With Bird defending, Jones lobbed a pass towards the basket, but it hit the top of the backboard. Cedric Maxwell tipped it to end the series as the Garden crowd stormed the court. Boston became the fourth team in NBA history to overcome a 3–1 series deficit, and the third team to do so in the Conference Finals.

    "1983 NBA playoffs": "The 1983 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 1982–83 season. This was the final postseason using the 12-team format and this is the final postseason held of best of 3 series in first round, before the NBA expanded the postseason to 16 teams and first round expanded of best of 5 series the next season. The tournament concluded with the Eastern Conference champion Philadelphia 76ers defeating the defending NBA champion and Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers 4 games to 0 in the NBA Finals. Moses Malone was named NBA Finals MVP.\nMalone made a famous prediction about the Sixers' chances prior to the playoffs, saying \"Fo', fo', fo'\" – predicting the number of games the Sixers would need to win each of the three series they would play on the way to a championship. They nearly accomplished this prediction of a sweep of all three rounds, only losing one game (to Milwaukee in the Eastern Conference Finals) en route to the championship. The Sixers set a record for highest winning percentage in the playoffs that was not broken until the Lakers went 15–1 in 2001. The Lakers' mark, however, came after the expansion to the current 16-team, four-round playoff format, which was first implemented in the 1984 playoffs, while the Sixers avoided the first round by virtue of their top seeding.\nIt was the third time in four years that the Lakers and 76ers had met in the NBA Finals, with the Lakers winning the previous two series.\nAfter missing the playoffs the previous year, the Blazers began a string of 21 straight playoff appearances in 1983 lasting until 2003. They made the playoffs 25 out of 26 years from their title-winning season of 1977–2003. The record was just one season shy of the 22-year playoff run set by the Syracuse Nationals/Philadelphia 76ers from 1950–1971.\nThe Celtics were swept out of the playoffs for the first time in team history, losing 4–0 to the Bucks in the second round.\nThis was the Spurs' last appearance in the Conference Finals until 1995. However, for players such as George Gervin and Artis Gilmore, the 6-game loss to the Lakers was the last chance they got at reaching the NBA Finals, let alone an NBA Championship (Gilmore did return to the conference finals with the Celtics in 1988, but played sparingly).\nThis was the only season of the 12-team playoff bracket in which all four division champions advanced to the conference finals.\n\nBracket\nFirst round\nEastern Conference first round\n(3) Boston Celtics vs. (6) Atlanta Hawks\nIn the decisive Game 3, Hawks center Tree Rollins and Celtics guard Danny Ainge started a melee on the Boston Garden floor in which Rollins bit Ainge's finger.\n\nThis was the seventh playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Celtics winning five of the first six meetings.\n\n(4) New Jersey Nets vs. (5) New York Knicks\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Nets and the Knicks.\n\nWestern Conference first round\n(3) Phoenix Suns vs. (6) Denver Nuggets\nMike Evans hits the game-tying 3-pointer with 37 seconds left to force OT.\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Suns winning the first meeting.\n\n(4) Seattle SuperSonics vs. (5) Portland Trail Blazers\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with the SuperSonics winning the first two meetings.\n\nConference semifinals\nEastern Conference semifinals\n(1) Philadelphia 76ers vs. (5) New York Knicks\nThis was the eighth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the 76ers winning five of the first seven meetings.\n\n(2) Milwaukee Bucks vs. (3) Boston Celtics\nFirst time the Celtics were swept in a playoff series since 1954.\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Celtics winning the first meeting.\n\nWestern Conference semifinals\n(1) Los Angeles Lakers vs. (5) Portland Trail Blazers\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Trail Blazers winning the first meeting.\n\n(2) San Antonio Spurs vs. (6) Denver Nuggets\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Nuggets and the Spurs.\n\nConference finals\nEastern Conference finals\n(1) Philadelphia 76ers vs. (2) Milwaukee Bucks\nJunior Bridgeman hits the game-tying shot with 42 seconds left to force OT.\n\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the 76ers winning two of the first three meetings.\n\nWestern Conference finals\n(1) Los Angeles Lakers vs. (2) San Antonio Spurs\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning the first meeting.\n\nNBA Finals: (E1) Philadelphia 76ers vs. (W1) Los Angeles Lakers\nThis was the fifth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning the first four meetings.\n\nSee also\nNBA records\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nBasketball-Reference.com's 1983 NBA Playoffs page",
    "1984 NBA playoffs": "The 1984 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 1983–84 season. The tournament concluded with the Eastern Conference champion Boston Celtics defeating the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers 4 games to 3 in the NBA Finals. Larry Bird was named NBA Finals MVP.\nThis was the first postseason allowing 16 teams to qualify, a format still in use.\nThe first round format was also changed from best-of-3 to best-of 5.\nIt was the first NBA Finals meeting between the Celtics and Lakers since 1969; they met 7 times in the Finals from 1959 to 1969, with Boston coming out on top each year. Going into the 1984 playoffs, the Lakers had already won 2 titles in the 1980s and the Celtics 1, making the revival of the Celtics–Lakers rivalry arguably inevitable and certainly highly anticipated.\nTwo teams made their playoff debuts and won their first playoff series: the Utah Jazz (who joined the NBA for the 1974–75 season as the New Orleans Jazz) and Dallas Mavericks, a 1980 expansion team. The Jazz did not miss the playoffs again until 2004.\nThe Detroit Pistons made the playoffs for the first time since 1977, starting a string of nine consecutive appearances that included five straight Conference Finals appearances (1987–1991), three consecutive NBA Finals appearances (1988, 1989, and 1990) and two NBA Championships. They did not miss the playoffs again until 1993.\nThe New Jersey Nets won a playoff series for the first time in their NBA history, upsetting the defending champion Philadelphia 76ers in 5. This was also the only time the road team won every game in a five-game playoff series. The Nets would not win a playoff series again until 2002.\nThis was the final postseason appearance for the Kansas City Kings, as the team moved to Sacramento, California two seasons later. Kemper Arena hosted its final NBA playoff game.\nThe Kingdome also hosted its final NBA playoff game, as the Seattle SuperSonics moved back full-time to the Seattle Center Coliseum two years later. However, the Kingdome continued to host Sonics regular season games on occasion until 1994.\nThe 1984 playoffs also involved two of the hottest games in NBA history. Game 5 of the First Round between the Knicks and Pistons was played at Joe Louis Arena, as the Pontiac Silverdome was unavailable, with temperatures reaching as high as 120°. Game 5 of the NBA Finals between the Celtics and Lakers at Boston Garden reached temperatures as high as 100°, as the Garden lacked air-conditioning, coupled with the sweltering outdoors conditions in Boston.\nThis is the last postseason of using the 2-2-1-1-1 format of the NBA Finals until 2014; the 1985 NBA Finals was changed to the 2-3-2 format the next season.\n\nBracket\nFirst round\nEastern Conference first round\n(1) Boston Celtics vs. (8) Washington Bullets\nRobert Parish hits the game-tying jumper with 21 seconds left to force OT.\n\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with each team winning one series apiece.\n\n(2) Milwaukee Bucks vs. (7) Atlanta Hawks\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Hawks and the Bucks.\n\n(3) Philadelphia 76ers vs. (6) New Jersey Nets\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the 76ers winning the first meeting.\n\n(4) Detroit Pistons vs. (5) New York Knicks\nBernard King/Isiah Thomas Duel.

After considering the Dallas Convention Center, they elected to play it at Moody Coliseum, where they had played their training camp; they had to play the game on SMU's college court, which meant having to measure and tape down an improvised 3-point line. Blackman forced a jump shot with time expiring to force overtime. The final play wound up lasting fourteen minutes. With one second left on the clock at mid-court trying to inbound the ball, Jay Vincent tried bounce the ball off Tom Chambers to run out the clock but Chambers caught the ball at mid-court and missed the shot. Dallas walked off the court believing the game was over. However, referee Mike Mathis and co-officials Jake O’Donnell and Tommy Nunez debated for several minutes what to do because the clock never actually started on the play. Somehow, Seattle was ruled to have the ball to inbound from midcourt with one second that saw the Mavericks ordered back on the court.

    "1986 NBA playoffs": "The 1986 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 1985–86 season. The tournament concluded with the Eastern Conference champion Boston Celtics defeating the Western Conference champion Houston Rockets 4 games to 2 in the NBA Finals. Larry Bird was named NBA Finals MVP for the second time.\nThis was the second NBA Finals meeting between the Celtics and Rockets; they met in the 1981 NBA Finals with the same result. It was the third of four straight Eastern Conference championships for Boston, who won 67 games that year, and went 40–1 at home. The Rockets, meanwhile had won just their second conference title in franchise history.\nSecond-year player Michael Jordan put on a record-setting performance in Game 2 of the Bulls' first-round series against the Celtics, scoring 63 points in a 2-OT loss, which surpassed Elgin Baylor's 61-point performance from the 1962 NBA Finals and still stands as the NBA Playoff scoring record. Jordan averaged 44.7 points per game in the series, but was unable to prevent the Bulls from being swept by a more experienced, more talented Celtics team. The Bulls set a dubious mark by posting the second worst record for a playoff-qualifying team in history, going just 30–52 during the season. Game 2, where the record was set, was ranked by TV Guide as the 26th Most Memorable Moment in Television History, and is credited with boosting the NBA's popularity surge and eventual rise to near the top of the United States television sports market, trailing only football by the mid-90s.\nThe 1986 playoffs marked the third time in four years that the Milwaukee Bucks advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals, but it would be their last appearance in the series until 2001. The Celtics avenged their 1983 sweep by sweeping the Bucks in four games.\nAs for the Philadelphia 76ers, this was the last time they would play in a Game 7 until 2001. After their first round loss to the Atlanta Hawks, the Detroit Pistons would advance past the first round in each of the next five seasons (1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991), which include all appearances in the conference finals, three NBA Finals, and two championships.\nAfter moving from Kansas City, where the franchise played its previous thirteen seasons, the Sacramento Kings made their first postseason appearance in their first season in its new city.\n\nBracket\nFirst round\nEastern Conference first round\n(1) Boston Celtics vs. (8) Chicago Bulls\nMichael Jordan hits the game-tying free throws with no time left in regulation to force the first OT; Danny Ainge hits the game-tying lay-up with 12 seconds left in the first OT to force the second OT.\nMichael Jordan's 63 points scored is an NBA playoff record, this was George Gervin's final NBA game.\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Celtics winning the first meeting.\n\n(2) Milwaukee Bucks vs. (7) New Jersey Nets\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Bucks winning the first meeting.\n\n(3) Philadelphia 76ers vs. (6) Washington Bullets\nDudley Bradley hits the game-winning 3 capping off a rally from 17 points down.\n\nThis was the fifth playoff meeting between these two teams, with each team winning two of the first four meetings.\n\n(4) Atlanta Hawks vs. (5) Detroit Pistons\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Hawks winning two of the first three meetings while in St. Louis.\n\nWestern Conference first round\n(1) Los Angeles Lakers vs. (8) San Antonio Spurs\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning the first two meetings.\n\n(2) Houston Rockets vs. (7) Sacramento Kings\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Rockets winning the first meeting.\n\n(3) Denver Nuggets vs. (6) Portland Trail Blazers\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Trail Blazers winning the first meeting.\n\n(4) Dallas Mavericks vs. (5) Utah Jazz\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Mavericks and the Jazz.\n\nConference semifinals\nEastern Conference semifinals\n(1) Boston Celtics vs. (4) Atlanta Hawks\nHawks only scored 1 field goal in the third quarter.\n\nThis was the eighth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Celtics winning six of the first seven meetings.\n\n(2) Milwaukee Bucks vs. (3) Philadelphia 76ers\nCharles Barkley's goaltending on Craig Hodges with 29 seconds left; Bob McAdoo's and Bobby Jones' final NBA game.\n\nThis was the sixth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the 76ers winning four of the first five meetings.\n\nWestern Conference semifinals\n(1) Los Angeles Lakers vs. (4) Dallas Mavericks\nDerek Harper redeemed himself from his 1984 mistake by hitting the game-winning 3 with 3 seconds left.\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning the first meeting.\n\n(2) Houston Rockets vs. (3) Denver Nuggets\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Nuggets and the Rockets.\n\nConference finals\nEastern Conference finals\n(1) Boston Celtics vs. (2) Milwaukee Bucks\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Celtics winning two of the first three meetings.\n\nWestern Conference finals\n(1) Los Angeles Lakers vs. (2) Houston Rockets\nRalph Sampson hits the famous off-balanced series winner at the buzzer; Hakeem Olajuwon was ejected in the fourth quarter for fighting Lakers forward Mitch Kupchak.\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Rockets winning the first meeting.\n\nNBA Finals: (E1) Boston Celtics vs. (W2) Houston Rockets\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Celtics winning the first three meetings.\n\nStatistical leaders\nSee also\nNBA records\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nBasketball-Reference.com's 1986 NBA Playoffs page\nEastern Conf.

The tournament concluded with the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers defeating the Eastern Conference champion Boston Celtics 4 games to 2 in the NBA Finals. The Lakers earned their 10th NBA championship, and Magic Johnson was named NBA Finals MVP for a then-record third time.\nThis was the last time the Celtics would appear in the NBA Finals until 2008. Boston only advanced as far as the Conference Finals twice in that stretch: losing the following year to the Detroit Pistons in six games and in 2002 to the New Jersey Nets, also in 6 games.\nThe Pistons appearance in the Eastern Conference Finals was the franchise's first (and their first Division/Conference Final appearance since 1962). It would be the first of five straight Conference Finals appearances for Detroit. They would make their first NBA Finals appearance since 1956 the following season, the first of 3 straight trips to the Finals (winning the last 2).\nThe Warriors & Pacers made their first playoff appearances since 1977 and 1981 respectively. The Pacers also won their first NBA playoff game, in Game 3 of their first-round series against the Hawks.\nGame 5 of the Philadelphia/Milwaukee series would the final game in the amazing career of Julius Erving.\nBy beating Dallas 3–1, the SuperSonics became the first #7 seed to defeat a #2 seed since the playoffs expanded to 16 teams in 1984.

Larry Bird scored 20 of his 34 points in the fourth quarter to help Boston overcome the 47 points scored by Dominique Wilkins.\nThe Dallas Mavericks made their first trip to the Western Conference Finals, losing in 7 to the Lakers. They would not advance that far again until 2003, and would not face the Lakers again until 2011.\nThe New York Knicks made the playoffs for the first time since 1984. They remained regulars until 2001, which included NBA Finals appearances in 1994 and 1999. On the other hand, the Washington Bullets did not return until 1997, and would not win a playoff game again until 2005 as the Wizards.\nIn the first round against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Michael Jordan scored 50 or more points twice—50 points in Game 1, and 55 points in Game 2—becoming the first player to do so in the same series.\nThis was the first time in NBA history that a game other than a Finals game was played during the month of June.\nGame 4 of the Atlanta-Milwaukee series was the last NBA game played at The MECCA.

This NBA playoffs also holds the record for the most sweeps in an entire NBA playoffs with 9 out of 15 series being decided in just 3 or 4 games.\nThe Lakers won the Western Conference title without losing a game, and entered the NBA Finals as the heavy favorites. However, they were swept in the Finals by the Pistons, due in part to season-ending injuries suffered by Magic Johnson and Byron Scott. The Lakers became the first team in NBA history to open an NBA post-season with 11 straight victories and to sweep three series in an NBA post-season.\nChicago advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 1975 (back when they were a member of the Western Conference) (and the first time in Michael Jordan's career), but their season was ended by Detroit for the second straight year. Two rounds earlier, Jordan hit \"The Shot\" over Craig Ehlo at the buzzer to beat the Cavs.\nThe Boston Celtics' first-round playoff sweep by the Pistons was the first time they failed to get past the round of 16. Boston's chances were hampered by the absence of Larry Bird during these playoffs due to a season-ending injury earlier in the season; the first and only time in Bird's NBA career he'd miss playing in the playoffs.\nFormer Utah Jazz head coach Jerry Sloan made the first of 19 playoff appearances in a 22-year tenure.

Prior to this, the Celtics had beaten the Knicks 26 straight at the Boston Garden.  This deciding game featured a missed dunk by Larry Bird late in the fourth with the Celtics trailing by four (103–99) and a clinching 3-point basket by Patrick Ewing on a play where he chased down an errant pass by Charles Oakley on the sideline in front of the Knicks' bench and hurled up a desperation shot as the shot clock was reaching zero.  The basket put the Knicks up 113-101 and essentially clinched the game and the series.\nThe Phoenix Suns defeated the Los Angeles Lakers in a playoff series for the first time ever.

It was the first time the Bulls won a playoff series over the Pistons since 1974, when both teams were still part of the Western Conference. Game 4 ended with some of the Pistons walking off the court before time expired, refusing to shake the Bulls' hands. The Pistons were vilified for this, however it was later revealed that the Pistons refused to shake hands with the Bulls because of comments said by Michael Jordan in a pre-game interview before the start of Game 4. In the 1989 NBA Finals, the Pistons themselves had swept the two-time defending champion Lakers. Detroit did not reach the conference finals again until 2003.\nThe seventh seeded Golden State Warriors stunned the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the playoffs, defeating them 3 games to 1.

The tournament concluded with the Eastern Conference champion Chicago Bulls defeating the Western Conference champion Portland Trail Blazers 4 games to 2 in the NBA Finals. Michael Jordan was named NBA Finals MVP for the second straight year.\nThe Blazers won their second Western Conference title in the past three years, and third overall in franchise history, behind the leadership of Clyde Drexler.\nThe Jazz made the Western Conference Finals for the first time in franchise history. They returned in 1994 and 1996 before finally breaking through in 1997.\nThe fourth-year Miami Heat became the first of the 1988 and 1989 expansion teams to make the playoffs, though they were swept in the first round by the Bulls. In 2006, the Heat would become the first of these teams to win the NBA title.\nThis was the first year since 1987 that the Bulls and Pistons did not meet in the playoffs. They did not meet again until 2007.\nThis was the first time since 1986, that the Pistons did not reach the Eastern Conference Finals, as well as, losing in the first round.\nThe Clippers made it to the playoffs for the first time since 1976, when they were the Buffalo Braves. It was also the first time since the Clippers' arrival in Los Angeles in 1984 that both of Los Angeles' NBA teams, the Clippers and Lakers, qualified for postseason play together.\nDespite Magic Johnson's stunning retirement due to testing HIV positive prior to the start of the season, the Los Angeles Lakers still managed to make their 16th straight NBA playoff appearance. It was their first appearance since 1974 without Johnson, Michael Cooper, or Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\nTwo games were postponed due to the Los Angeles riots following the Rodney King verdict, one being the Trail Blazers at the Lakers and the other was the Jazz at the Clippers. For safety purposes, both the Lakers and Clippers decided to move their home games to a nearby alternate venue; the Lakers played at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada (formerly an alternate home arena of the Jazz in 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons; later host to the 2007 NBA All-Star Game) for Game 4, the Clippers at Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim, California for Game 4 (the Clippers returned to Anaheim at Arrowhead Pond in 1994 as an alternate venue and played there until 1999 whenever the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena was unavailable).\nGame 4 of the Blazers-Suns series was the last game ever played at the Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum. It was a long game that lasted two overtimes and broke the NBA's playoff game record for points scored in one game, the Trail Blazers outlasting the Suns by a score of 153–151.\nThe Celtics' first-round sweep of the Pacers would be their last playoff series win until 2002. After losing in the second round to Cleveland, Larry Bird retired after 13 seasons. As for the Cavs, it was their first Conference Finals appearance since 1976, but fell to the Bulls in 6 games.

The tournament concluded with the Eastern Conference champion Chicago Bulls defeating the Western Conference champion Phoenix Suns 4 games to 2 in the NBA Finals. Michael Jordan was named NBA Finals MVP for the third straight year. This was the Suns' second Western Conference title; they made their first NBA Finals appearance since 1976, losing to the Boston Celtics. John Paxson made the series-clinching three-point shot in Game Six of the  NBA Finals, securing the Bulls' first of two three-peats during the decade.\nThe Knicks–Pacers rivalry started in their first-round encounter, which New York won, 3–1. But it wasn't until the next two meetings (1994 and 1995) that the rivalry became even more intense, particularly due to Reggie Miller's heroics in the Garden that made him a household name and Indiana legitimate contenders in the East.\nThe Charlotte Hornets made their playoff debut. Their opening-round series versus Boston was also the last time the Celtics made the playoffs with Kevin McHale, who retired after the series, and Robert Parish, who left as a free agent. Game 1 of the series was the final game of Reggie Lewis' career, as he collapsed during the first quarter and did not play for the rest of the series; he died in July of a heart attack.\nThis was the first edition of the playoffs since 1983 to not feature the Detroit Pistons, who previously made nine straight appearances from 1984 to 1992.\nGame 7 of the Western Conference Finals saw the Suns attempt sixty-four free throws while connecting on fifty-seven of them, both NBA postseason records.\n\nBracket\nFirst round\nEastern Conference first round\n(1) New York Knicks vs. (8) Indiana Pacers\nJohn Starks is ejected after headbutting Reggie Miller.\n\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Pacers and the Knicks.\n\n(2) Chicago Bulls vs. (7) Atlanta Hawks\nMichael Jordan hits the half-court shot at the buzzer to end the first half.\n\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Hawks winning both meetings.\n\n(3) Cleveland Cavaliers vs. (6) New Jersey Nets\nBernard King's final NBA game.\n\nMaurice Cheeks and Dražen Petrović's final NBA game; Petrović dies a month later in a car crash.\nThis would be the last playoff series victory for Cleveland without LeBron James until 2024.\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Cavaliers winning the first meeting.\n\n(4) Boston Celtics vs. (5) Charlotte Hornets\nCeltics forward Reggie Lewis's final NBA game, he collapses on the court and did not play for the rest of the series; he dies 3 months later from a heart defect.\n\nXavier McDaniel hits the game-tying jumper with 25.8 seconds left in regulation to force the first OT; Kevin McHale hits the game-tying jumper with 6 seconds left in the first OT to force the second OT.\n\nAlonzo Mourning hits the series-winning shot with 4 tenths left; also Kevin McHale's final NBA game.\n\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Celtics and the Hornets.\n\nWestern Conference first round\n(1) Phoenix Suns vs. (8) Los Angeles Lakers\nDan Majerle hits the game-tying shot with 13.6 seconds left to force OT; After losing the first two games of the series,  at the post game press conference Suns head coach Paul Westphal said that they would go to LA and win the next two games and then come back to Phoenix and win game 5, \"and everyone will say what a great series it was.\"\n\nThis was the eighth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning six of the first seven meetings.\n\n(2) Houston Rockets vs. (7) Los Angeles Clippers\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Rockets and the Clippers.\n\n(3) Seattle SuperSonics vs. (6) Utah Jazz\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Jazz winning the first meeting.\n\n(4) Portland Trail Blazers vs. (5) San Antonio Spurs\nSean Elliott hits the game-tying lay-up with 1:27 left to force OT.\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Trail Blazers winning the first meeting.\n\nConference semifinals\nEastern Conference semifinals\n(1) New York Knicks vs. (5) Charlotte Hornets\nAlonzo Mourning hits the game-tying shot with 30.9 seconds left in regulation to force the first OT, then hits the game-tying free throws with 12 seconds left in the first OT to force the second OT.\n\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Hornets and the Knicks.\n\n(2) Chicago Bulls vs. (3) Cleveland Cavaliers\nMichael Jordan hits the series-winning shot at the buzzer against Cleveland for the second time in his career.\n\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Bulls winning the first three meetings.\n\nWestern Conference semifinals\n(1) Phoenix Suns vs. (5) San Antonio Spurs\nCharles Barkley hits the series-winning shot with 1.8 seconds left, also the Spurs played their final game at the HemisFair Arena before moving to the Alamodome the following season.\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Suns winning the first meeting.\n\n(2) Houston Rockets vs. (3) Seattle SuperSonics\nThis Game mark the final time the NBA Playoffs aired only Locally.\n\nRicky Pierce hits the game-tying shot with 23.9 seconds left to force OT.\n\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the SuperSonics winning the first three meetings.\n\nConference finals\nEastern Conference finals\n(1) New York Knicks vs. (2) Chicago Bulls\nJohn Starks' famous dunk on Horace Grant with 47.3 seconds left in the game.\n\nMichael Jordan scores 54 points, the most against the Knicks in a playoff game by any player.\n\nB.

However, they recovered to win Games 3 and 4 in Los Angeles to tie the series at 2–2. In Game 5, Dan Majerie hit an off-balance mid-range to force overtime. The Suns eventually pulled away to win Game 5, 112–104, at home to avoid becoming the first #1 seed to lose to a #8 seed. This would happen the following postseason, when the #8 Denver Nuggets defeated the #1 Seattle SuperSonics 3–2 (the Nuggets came back from a 2–0 series deficit to pull it off).\nBoth #5 seeds, Charlotte and San Antonio, beat their #4 seeded opponent in the first round.\nThe fifth-year Charlotte Hornets made their playoff debut, and became the first of the 1988/89 expansion teams (Charlotte, Orlando, Minnesota, and Miami) to win a playoff series, beating Boston 3–1.\nThe New York Knicks took a 2–0 series lead over the Chicago Bulls in the Conference Finals. However, headlines in New York papers and tabloids angered and energized Bulls superstar Michael Jordan, who torched the Knicks for 54 points in Game 4  after shooting 3–18 in Game 3 to even up the series. This performance surpassed Sam Jones's 51-point game against the 1967 Knicks as the most points ever scored by a player against the Knicks in a playoff game. The Bulls went to Madison Square Garden, won Game 5 97–94, and clinched the series at home in Game 6 with a 96–88 victory.\nCeltics' star Reggie Lewis fainted on the court during Game 1 against the Hornets. He briefly returned to the game before sitting out the rest of the series. He died less than three months later from a heart condition.\nAfter the Suns defeated the Sonics in Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals, there were complaints about the free throw comparison between the two teams.\nGame 6 of the Suns–Spurs series was the last game ever played at the HemisFair Arena.\nThe Cavaliers defeated the Nets in the Eastern Conference First Round, which was their last playoff series victory until 2006, and their last without LeBron James until 2024. Game 5 of that series was also the last game played by Dražen Petrović, who died in a car accident five weeks later.\n\nSee also\nNBA records\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nBasketball-Reference.com's 1993 NBA Playoffs page\nEastern Conf.

    "1994 NBA playoffs": "The 1994 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 1993-94 season. The tournament concluded with the Western Conference champion Houston Rockets defeating the Eastern Conference champion New York Knicks 4 games to 3 in the NBA Finals. Hakeem Olajuwon was named NBA Finals MVP.\nThis was also the first time that the Boston Celtics (since 1979) and Los Angeles Lakers (since 1976) missed the playoffs. It was their first absence from the playoffs since the playoff field expanded to 16 teams in 1984. It was also the first time that both missed the playoffs in the same year. This would not occur again until 2014. It also marked the first time both of the two Los Angeles-based NBA teams, the Lakers and Clippers (who arrived in L.A. in 1984), missed the playoffs together.\nThe biggest upset came in the first round, when the Denver Nuggets came back from a 2–0 deficit to beat the Seattle SuperSonics in five games, marking the first time in NBA history that an eighth seed had defeated a #1 seed. Denver stretched their improbable playoff run with the Utah Jazz to seven games after being down 0–3, but Utah defeated them in Game 7 91–81.\nThe playoffs also featured the first playoff series victory for the Indiana Pacers in their 18-year NBA existence, as they swept the Orlando Magic (who were making their first playoff appearance in franchise history) in the first round, then eliminated the top-seeded Atlanta Hawks 4–2 in the second round. The Pacers advanced within one game of the NBA Finals, but lost Games 6 and 7 of the Eastern Conference finals to the Knicks.\nThis was the first time since the ABA–NBA merger prior to the 1976–77 season that all former ABA teams (Pacers, Nuggets, Spurs, and Nets) made the playoffs in the same year.\nThe Chicago Bulls, who made the playoffs despite the retirement of Michael Jordan, swept the Cleveland Cavaliers in the first round, but then lost in seven games to the Knicks in the Eastern Conference Semifinals.\nThe Knicks made history by playing a record 25 playoff games (one short of the maximum), the most postseason games an NBA team has played. The 2005 Detroit Pistons tied this record. However, it was broken by the 2008 Celtics. Their easiest series was the first-round 3–1 win over the Nets. New York then forced three consecutive Game 7s, eliminating the Bulls 4–3 in the Conference Semifinals, knocking off the Pacers 4–3 in the conference finals, both times at Madison Square Garden, before losing in Game 7 to the Rockets at The Summit in the NBA Finals, which meant New York was denied NBA and NHL titles. Game 4 of the Finals took place at the Garden a day after the New York Rangers won their first Stanley Cup in 54 years in Game 7 of the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals. Knicks coach Pat Riley made history by becoming the first (and to this date, the only) person in NBA history to have coached a Game 7 in the NBA Finals for two teams, having been with the Lakers in 1984 and 1988.\nIn the Western Conference, the Golden State Warriors made their last playoff appearance until 2007. Game 3 of the Suns–Warriors series would be the last playoff game to take place inside the original bowl of the Oakland Coliseum Arena; the building was heavily renovated with increased seating capacity throughout the 1996–97 season, during which the Warriors moved to San Jose Arena, home of the NHL's San Jose Sharks. The arena was reopened the following season.\nGame 3 of the Bulls-Cavaliers series was the last game played at the Richfield Coliseum.\nGame 6 of the Bulls-Knicks series was the last game played at Chicago Stadium.\nGame 5 of the Nuggets-Sonics series was the last to be played at Seattle Center Coliseum before its first renovation and eventual rechristening as KeyArena in 1995. During the renovations, the Sonics played the intervening 1994–95 NBA season at Tacoma Dome in nearby Tacoma, Washington; the arena had also been used intermittently by them during the early 1990s. After the SuperSonics relocated to and rebranded as the Oklahoma City Thunder in 2008, the building (which is still being used by the Sonics' former WNBA sister team Seattle Storm) later received a second renovation project to accommodate the NHL's Seattle Kraken. This third iteration of the Coliseum became Climate Pledge Arena and was reopened in 2021.\nThis postseason was notable for the infamous broadcast interruption of NFL Hall of Famer O. J. Simpson's slow speed freeway chase with the Los Angeles Police Department.  During Game 5 of the 1994 NBA Finals, most NBC affiliates split the coverage of the game between the chase. At the time, Simpson was an NFL analyst on NBC.\nThis would be last time when neither conference's number one seed reached the conference finals until 2021.\n\nClock incident\nThe clock incident happened in the last moments of game 4 of the Western Conference finals between the Rockets and Jazz. Tom Chambers inbounded the ball to Jeff Hornacek with 13.5 seconds left and Utah down 2. As play resumed, the Jazz timekeeper did not start the clock as they were trying to look for an open shot. After 8 seconds, the clock finally started as Chambers got the ball down low but Utah did not take advantage of the extra time they were given, and after Chambers attempted a shot and missed, there was a mad scramble for the ball. It ended up in Robert Horry's hands, who passed it to Kenny Smith; Houston ran out the clock to win 80–78.\n\nBracket\nFirst round\nEastern Conference first round\n(1) Atlanta Hawks vs. (8) Miami Heat\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Hawks and the Heat.\n\n(2) New York Knicks vs. (7) New Jersey Nets\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Knicks winning the first meeting.\n\n(3) Chicago Bulls vs. (6) Cleveland Cavaliers\nFinal Cavaliers game at Richfield Coliseum.\n\nThis was the fifth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Bulls winning the first four meetings.\n\n(4) Orlando Magic vs. (5) Indiana Pacers\nByron Scott hits the game-winning 3 with 2 seconds left.\n\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Pacers and the Magic.\n\nWestern Conference first round\n(1) Seattle SuperSonics vs. (8) Denver Nuggets\nDenver becomes the first 8th seed to beat the 1st seed in playoff history.\n\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with each team winning one series apiece.\n\n(2) Houston Rockets vs. (7) Portland Trail Blazers\nHakeem's big block on Rod Strickland's layup.\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Rockets winning the first meeting.\n\n(3) Phoenix Suns vs. (6) Golden State Warriors\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Suns winning the first two meetings.\n\n(4) San Antonio Spurs vs. (5) Utah Jazz\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Spurs and the Jazz.\n\nConference semifinals\nEastern Conference semifinals\n(1) Atlanta Hawks vs. (5) Indiana Pacers\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Hawks winning the first meeting.\n\n(2) New York Knicks vs. (3) Chicago Bulls\nToni Kukoč hits the game-winner at the buzzer.\n\nHue Hollins' controversial foul call.\n\nScottie Pippen's famous dunk on Patrick Ewing; final Bulls game at Chicago Stadium.\n\nThis was the sixth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Bulls winning the first five meetings.\n\nWestern Conference semifinals\n(2) Houston Rockets vs. (3) Phoenix Suns\nKevin Johnson's famous dunk on Hakeem Olajuwon.\n\nThe Rockets become the second team to win a best-of-seven playoff series after losing the first 2 games at home.\n\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Rockets and the Suns.\n\n(5) Utah Jazz vs. (8) Denver Nuggets\nKarl Malone hits the game-tying shot with 9.2 seconds left.\n\nReggie Williams hits the game-winner with 1.9 seconds left.\n\nDenver became the first team since the 1951 New York Knicks to force a Game 7 after being down 0–3.\n\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with each team winning one series apiece.\n\nConference finals\nEastern Conference finals\n(2) New York Knicks vs. (5) Indiana Pacers\nReggie Miller's 25-point 4th quarter performance.\n\nPatrick Ewing's clutch dunk with 26.9 seconds left.\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Knicks winning the first meeting.\n\nWestern Conference finals\n(2) Houston Rockets vs. (5) Utah Jazz\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Jazz winning the first meeting.\n\nNBA Finals (W2) Houston Rockets vs. (E2) New York Knicks\nSam Cassell hits the game-winning 3 with 32.6 seconds left.\n\nHakeem Olajuwon blocks John Starks' title-winning 3-point attempt.\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Rockets winning the first meeting.\n\nStatistical leaders\nSee also\nNBA records\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nBasketball-Reference.com's 1994 NBA Playoffs page",
    "1995 NBA playoffs": "The 1995 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 1994–95 season. The tournament concluded with the Western Conference champion Houston Rockets sweeping the Eastern Conference champion Orlando Magic in the NBA Finals. Hakeem Olajuwon was named NBA Finals MVP for the second straight time.\nAs of 2024, the 1995 Rockets are the lowest-seeded team to win the NBA Championship.\nHouston became the eighth team to win back-to-back titles (after the Minneapolis Lakers of 1949 and 1950, and again 1952–54, and the Celtics dynasty of 1959–66 and again in 1968–69, as the LA Lakers of 1987 and 1988, Pistons of 1989 and 1990 and Bulls of 1991, 1992 and 1993). It would go on to happen five more times, with the Bulls winning 3 more from 1996 to 1998, the Lakers from 2000 to 2002 and 2009–2010, the Miami Heat from 2012 to 2013, and the Golden State Warriors from 2017 to 2018.  The Rockets championships were also part of a run that saw 4 teams win consecutive titles (The Lakers 1987–88, Pistons 1989–90, Bulls 1991–93 and 1996–98, Rockets 1994–95). That streak was stopped by a Spurs franchise, who like the Celtics of the 1980s, didn't win back-to-back titles, but did win numerous championships and are considered a dynasty.\nThe sixth-seeded Rockets (47–35) took out four impressive opponents on their way to the title, defeating the 3rd-seeded Utah Jazz (60–22), 2nd-seeded Phoenix Suns (59–23), top-seeded San Antonio Spurs (62–20) and Eastern Conference champion Orlando Magic (57–25) in the NBA Finals. In the first round against the Utah Jazz, the Houston Rockets came back from a 2-1 series deficit, winning Game 5 in Utah. In the second round against the Suns, the Rockets came back from a 2–0 and 3–1 series deficit without home-court advantage, winning Games 5 and 7 in Phoenix. Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon dominated league MVP David Robinson and Shaquille O'Neal in consecutive series to win the title. The Rockets 47 wins were the fewest by an NBA champion since the Washington Bullets tallied 44 in 1978.\nThe 1995 Playoffs featured the first three playoff series victories in Magic history, as they beat the Boston Celtics, Chicago Bulls, and Indiana Pacers to win their first Eastern Conference title.\nIt also featured the return of Michael Jordan to the playoffs after a year and a half absence, returning in March, and the only time the Bulls didn't win a title with him on the roster since they started their string of consecutive titles in 1991.\nGame 4 of the Celtics-Magic series was the last game played at Boston Garden. Boston returned to the playoffs in 2002, this time in the new FleetCenter (now TD Garden).\nGame 3 of the Blazers-Suns series was the last game played at the then-Memorial Coliseum (renamed the Veterans Memorial Coliseum as of 2012). The Blazers continued their playoff streak at Rose Garden (now Moda Center) for the next 7 years.\nGame 3 of the Spurs-Nuggets series was the final playoff game at McNichols Sports Arena; the Nuggets missed the playoffs in each of the arena's final four years. Denver returned to the playoffs in 2004, this time in the new Pepsi Center (now Ball Arena).\nThe Pacers made the Eastern Conference Finals for the second straight year (and finally defeated the New York Knicks on their way to doing so), but found the Magic too powerful to overcome. Coincidentally, they met all three playoff opponents (Orlando, Atlanta, and New York) they had in 1994, just in a different order.\nSince the NBA playoffs expanded to 16 teams in 1984, the Jazz became the second team (along with the 1994 SuperSonics) to win at least 60 regular season games and lose in the first round, when they lost to the eventual NBA champion Rockets.\nThis marked the first time that every first and second round game of the playoffs was televised nationally. In previous years, a few early round games were not picked up by the NBA's national TV partners.\n\nBracket\nFirst round\nEastern Conference first round\n(1) Orlando Magic vs. (8) Boston Celtics\nGame 4 was the last game at Boston Garden.\n\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Celtics and the Magic.\n\n(2) Indiana Pacers vs. (7) Atlanta Hawks\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with each team winning one series apiece.\n\n(3) New York Knicks vs. (6) Cleveland Cavaliers\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Knicks winning the first meeting.\n\n(4) Charlotte Hornets vs. (5) Chicago Bulls\nMichael Jordan made the series winning free throws with 1:07 left\n\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Hornets and the Bulls.\n\nWestern Conference first round\n(1) San Antonio Spurs vs. (8) Denver Nuggets\nGame 3 was the final playoff game at McNichols Sports Arena.\n\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Spurs winning two of the first three meetings.\n\n(2) Phoenix Suns vs. (7) Portland Trail Blazers\nGame 3 was the Blazers' final game at Memorial Coliseum.\n\nThis was the fifth playoff meeting between these two teams, with each team winning two series apiece.\n\n(3) Utah Jazz vs. (6) Houston Rockets\nJohn Stockton made the game-winning lay-up with 2.4 seconds left.\n\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with each team winning one series apiece.\n\n(4) Seattle SuperSonics vs. (5) Los Angeles Lakers\nThis was the sixth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning three of the first five meetings.\n\nConference semifinals\nEastern Conference semifinals\n(1) Orlando Magic vs. (5) Chicago Bulls\nNick Anderson's clutch steal off Michael Jordan led to his comments on Jordan's jersey number 45, saying he thought Jordan was playing like a 45-year-old.

    "1996 NBA playoffs": "The 1996 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 1995–96 season. The tournament concluded with the Eastern Conference champion Chicago Bulls defeating the Western Conference champion Seattle SuperSonics 4 games to 2. Michael Jordan was named NBA Finals MVP for a then record fourth time.\n\nOverview\nThe Chicago Bulls entered the NBA playoffs with a record of 72–10 (the best regular season record until the 2016 Golden State Warriors went 73–9), eclipsing the 1972 Los Angeles Lakers record of 69–13, helped by Michael Jordan's first full season back from his mid-1990's retirement and the addition of another future Hall of Famer to the Bulls, Dennis Rodman. The SuperSonics were only the tenth team in NBA history to win 64 games during the regular season, but their feat went largely unnoticed due to Chicago's record 72 wins.\nThis was the Sacramento Kings' first playoff appearance since 1986, but would be Mitch Richmond's only one as a King (he previously appeared twice in the playoffs for the Golden State Warriors in 1989 and 1991). The Kings did not make it back until 1999, which began their eight-year string of playoff appearances. Richmond would be traded to the Wizards in 1998 and would later win his first and only championship with the Lakers in 2002 (he would retire shortly thereafter).\nGame 4 of the Lakers-Rockets series was Magic Johnson's final NBA game. He would retire for good after a brief in-season comeback following the loss.\nAs for the two-time defending NBA champion Houston Rockets, their quest for a 3-peat was thwarted by the Seattle SuperSonics, who swept the Rockets 4–0 in the Western Conference Semifinals. The SuperSonics were also the last team to defeat the Rockets in the playoffs before their two–year title run, in the 1993 Western Conference Semifinals (Seattle won 4–3). Also noted during their two-year title run, the Rockets never faced the SuperSonics in the playoffs as they were eliminated in the first round by both the Denver Nuggets and the Los Angeles Lakers, respectively.\nThe 1996 Eastern Conference Finals between the Chicago Bulls and Orlando Magic were redemption for Michael Jordan after his first return to the playoffs in 1995 and the Bulls' disappointing second-round loss to the 1995 Orlando Magic, a team that would be swept in last year's finals. With Jordan leading the way, the Bulls swept the defending Eastern Conference champion Magic, winning all four games by an average of 17 points. As for the Magic, it ended a three-year run of dominance for the team, as Shaquille O'Neal went on to sign with the Lakers the following season. The Magic did not have another 50-win season, division title and first round playoff series victory until 2008, followed the season afterward by an Eastern Conference championship and the franchise's second NBA Finals appearance in 2009 to which they lost to the Lakers.\nWith their Western Conference Finals victory over the Utah Jazz, the Seattle SuperSonics made the NBA Finals for the first time since 1979. They wouldn't return ever again because the franchise was sold after drafting future Pro Basketball Hall of Famer, Kevin Durant. With the win, the SuperSonics vindicated themselves as well after their stunning first-round loss to the Denver Nuggets in 1994, when they had become the first top seeded team to lose to an eighth-seed in the NBA playoffs. Despite the Jazz losing in seven games to the SuperSonics in the Western Conference Finals (their third appearance in 5 years), in retrospect it kickstarted their own Finals run, which they ultimately accomplished in 1997 and 1998, but lost both times to the Bulls.\nBy winning their fourth title in six years, the Bulls capped what many consider to be the greatest season in NBA history, finishing with a combined 87–13 record, including 72–10 in the regular season and 15–3 in the postseason. In addition, they remain the first and only team to win 70+ games in the regular season and win the NBA championship.\n\nBracket\nPlayoff qualifying\nWestern Conference\nBest record in conference\nThe Seattle SuperSonics clinched the best record in the Western Conference, and had home court advantage throughout the Western Conference playoffs.\n\nClinched a playoff berth\nThe following teams clinched a playoff berth in the West:\n\nSeattle SuperSonics (64–18, clinched Pacific division)\nSan Antonio Spurs (59–23, clinched Midwest division)\nUtah Jazz (55–27)\nLos Angeles Lakers (53–29)\nHouston Rockets (48–34)\nPortland Trail Blazers (44–38)\nPhoenix Suns (41-41)\nSacramento Kings (39–43)\n\nEastern Conference\nBest record in NBA\nThe Chicago Bulls clinched the best record in the NBA, and earned home court advantage throughout the entire playoffs.\n\nClinched a playoff berth\nThe following teams clinched a playoff berth in the East:\n\nChicago Bulls (72–10, clinched Central Division)\nOrlando Magic (60–22, clinched Atlantic division)\nIndiana Pacers (52–30)\nCleveland Cavaliers (47–35)\nNew York Knicks (47–35)\nAtlanta Hawks (46–36)\nDetroit Pistons (46–36)\nMiami Heat (42–40)\n\nNotes\nFor the fourth straight postseason, both #5 seeds beat their #4 seeded opponent in the first round.\n\nFirst round\nEastern Conference first round\n(1) Chicago Bulls vs. (8) Miami Heat\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Bulls winning the first meeting.\n\n(2) Orlando Magic vs. (7) Detroit Pistons\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Pistons and the Magic.\n\n(3) Indiana Pacers vs. (6) Atlanta Hawks\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Pacers winning two of the first three meetings.\n\n(4) Cleveland Cavaliers vs. (5) New York Knicks\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Knicks winning the first two meetings.\n\nWestern Conference first round\n(1) Seattle SuperSonics vs. (8) Sacramento Kings\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Kings and the SuperSonics.\n\n(2) San Antonio Spurs vs. (7) Phoenix Suns\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Suns winning the first two meetings.\n\n(3) Utah Jazz vs. (6) Portland Trail Blazers\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Trail Blazers winning two of the first three meetings.\n\n(4) Los Angeles Lakers vs. (5) Houston Rockets\nGame 4 is Magic Johnson's final NBA game.\n\nThis was the fifth playoff meeting between these two teams, with each team winning two series apiece.\n\nConference semifinals\nEastern Conference semifinals\n(1) Chicago Bulls vs. (5) New York Knicks\nDown by 8 late in the 4th quarter, Michael Jordan leads the Bulls on a personal 8–0 run including hitting the game-tying 3 with 19.4 seconds left to force OT\n\nBill Wennington hits the game-winner with 36.9 seconds left.\n\nThis was the seventh playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Bulls winning five of the first six meetings.\n\n(2) Orlando Magic vs. (6) Atlanta Hawks\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Hawks and the Magic.\n\nWestern Conference semifinals\n(1) Seattle SuperSonics vs. (5) Houston Rockets\nThis was the fifth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the SuperSonics winning the first four meetings.

    "1997 NBA playoffs": "The 1997 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 1996–97 season. The tournament concluded with the defending NBA champion and Eastern Conference champion Chicago Bulls defeating the Western Conference champion Utah Jazz 4 games to 2. This was the Bulls' second straight title, and fifth overall (They completed the 3-peat by beating Utah again in 1998). Michael Jordan was named NBA Finals MVP for the fifth time.\n\nOverview\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves made their playoff debut after failing to win more than 30 games in their first 7 seasons. It was also the first of 7 straight years in which they made the playoffs only to lose in the first round. They were the last of the 1988/89 expansion four to make their playoff debut.\nThe Phoenix Suns made the playoffs despite starting the season with 13 straight losses.  Their 0–13 start is an NBA record for the most losses to start a season by a team that went on to make the postseason.\nAll four 1988/89 expansion teams (Minnesota, Miami, Orlando and Charlotte) made the playoffs for the first time. This would happen again in 2001.\nBoth eighth seeds in the 1997 Playoffs, the Washington Bullets and the Los Angeles Clippers, broke long playoff droughts (Bullets eight years, Clippers only just three) with this season's playoff appearances. (The Bullets' last playoff appearance was in 1988; the Clippers in 1993). Unfortunately for both teams, it would be a long time before they made the playoffs again; the renamed Wizards made their return in 2005; the Clippers in 2006). The Bullets qualified by defeating the Cleveland Cavaliers in a regular season finale that saw both teams fighting for the #8 seed.\nThis season was the first, and to date only, season since the ABA–NBA merger that none of the four former ABA teams (the San Antonio Spurs, the Denver Nuggets, the Indiana Pacers, and the New Jersey Nets) qualified for the playoffs. It was also one of only four times that the Spurs failed to make the playoffs since their admission to the NBA. The Spurs would not miss the playoffs again until 2020.\nThe Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena hosted its final NBA playoff game in Game 3 of the Clippers–Jazz series. When the Clippers returned to the playoffs in 2006, they had moved to the Staples Center (Now Crypto.com Arena), their home since the 1999–2000 season. The Sports Arena remained active until its closure and demolition in 2016; the site is now Banc of California Stadium, home to MLS' Los Angeles FC.\nGame 3 of the Bulls–Bullets series was the last playoff game ever played at the USAir Arena. They moved into a new arena in December of the next season. It was also the final game for the Washington Bullets. They changed their team name to the Wizards on May 15, making it the last time the team was officially named the \"Bullets\".\nWith their first round victory over the Orlando Magic, the Miami Heat won a playoff series for the first time in franchise history.\nGame 4 of the Bulls–Hawks series was the last game ever played at the Omni Coliseum. The Hawks' home playoff games for 1998 and 1999 were played at the Georgia Dome while the Omni was demolished to make way for what is now State Farm Arena, which would open in September 1999.\nThe Miami Heat became the sixth team in NBA History to come back from a 3–1 series deficit with their conference semifinals win over the New York Knicks. Ironically, their run to the Eastern Conference Finals marked the farthest they had reached in the playoffs up to that point; they did not return until 2005, and won the NBA Finals in 2006. They would not beat the Knicks again in a playoff series until 2012.\nThis was the first Western Conference title for the Jazz in their 23–year history, with their series win against the Houston Rockets. After losing in the Western Conference Finals to the Jazz, the Rockets would not win a playoff series until 2009 and would not return to the Conference Finals until 2015.\n\nBracket\nPlayoff qualifying\nWestern Conference\nBest record in conference\nThe Utah Jazz clinched the best record in the Western Conference, and had home court advantage throughout the Western Conference playoffs.\n\nClinched a playoff berth\nThe following teams clinched a playoff berth in the West:\n\nUtah Jazz (64–18, clinched Midwest division)\nSeattle SuperSonics (57–25, clinched Pacific division)\nHouston Rockets (57–25)\nLos Angeles Lakers (56–26)\nPortland Trail Blazers (49–33)\nMinnesota Timberwolves (40–42)\nPhoenix Suns (40–42)\nLos Angeles Clippers (36–46)\n\nEastern Conference\nBest record in NBA\nThe Chicago Bulls clinched the best record in the NBA, and earned home court advantage throughout the entire playoffs.\n\nClinched a playoff berth\nThe following teams clinched a playoff berth in the East:\n\nChicago Bulls (69–13, clinched Central division)\nMiami Heat (61–21, clinched Atlantic division)\nNew York Knicks (57–25)\nAtlanta Hawks (56–26)\nDetroit Pistons (54–28)\nCharlotte Hornets (54–28)\nOrlando Magic (45–37)\nWashington Bullets (44–38)\n\nMemorable moments\nThe 1997 NBA Playoffs featured numerous clutch shots and other moments.\n\nApril 30: Chicago Bulls vs. Washington Bullets, Game 3\nScottie Pippen made the series-winning dunk with 7.4 seconds left as the Bulls swept the Bullets 96–95 and advanced.\n\nMay 1: Seattle SuperSonics vs. Phoenix Suns, Game 4\nWith his team trailing 107–104 with 4.3 seconds left, Phoenix guard Rex Chapman took the inbounds pass, launched a 3-point shot while falling out of bounds, and made the shot to tie the game. The Sonics would however win in OT 122–115.\n\nMay 6: Chicago Bulls vs. Atlanta Hawks, Game 1\nScottie Pippen broke a 97–97 tie by making a 3-point shot with 43.9 seconds left. Neither team would score after that, and the Bulls beat Atlanta 100–97.\n\nMay 14: New York Knicks vs. Miami Heat, Game 5\nA courtside brawl erupted when Heat forward P.J. Brown body-slammed Knicks guard Charlie Ward causing both teams' benches to clear. For the Knicks, Patrick Ewing, John Starks, Allan Houston and Larry Johnson left the bench. All of the players involved were suspended. The Knicks, under-manned by the suspensions, lost the series in 7 games to start the Heat-Knicks rivalry. This was the first time in history where a New York-based major league sports team lost a playoff series after securing a 3–1 series lead; this would later be repeated when the New York Yankees blew a 3–0 series lead against the Boston Red Sox in 2004 and when the New York Rangers blew a 3–1 series lead against the Washington Capitals in 2009.\n\nMay 25: Utah Jazz vs. Houston Rockets, Game 4\nEddie Johnson made a 3 as time expired to tie the Western Conference Finals at 2.\n\nMay 29: Utah Jazz vs. Houston Rockets, Game 6\nJohn Stockton scored 25 points and Karl Malone scored 24.

Chicago regained possession and Michael Jordan hit a jumper as time expired for the Bulls to win 84–82.\n\nJune 13: Chicago Bulls vs. Utah Jazz, Game 6\nWith most NBC viewers thinking Jordan would take the last shot with the game tied at 86, he instead passed to Steve Kerr, who made a 17-foot shot with 5 seconds left. On the next play, Scottie Pippen stole Bryon Russell's inbound pass and rolled the ball to Toni Kukoč, who clinched the title with a dunk.\n\nNotes\nFor the first time since 1992, a #5 seed did not beat their #4 seeded opponent in the first round.\nThis would be the last postseason until 2004 to feature teams with sub .500 records.\nUntil 2020, this is the most recent postseason where a Western Conference team (Minnesota, Phoenix, and the Los Angeles Clippers) qualified with a losing record.\n\nFirst round\nEastern Conference first round\n(1) Chicago Bulls vs. (8) Washington Bullets\nMichael Jordan scores 20 of the Bulls' 23 points in the fourth quarter\n\nScottie Pippen stuffs in the series winning dunk with 7.0 seconds left\n\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Bulls and the Bullets/Wizards franchise.\n\n(2) Miami Heat vs. (7) Orlando Magic\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Heat and the Magic as well as the first postseason meeting between two Florida-based professional sports teams.\n\n(3) New York Knicks vs. (6) Charlotte Hornets\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Knicks winning the first meeting.\n\n(4) Atlanta Hawks vs. (5) Detroit Pistons\nThis was the seventh playoff meeting between these two teams, with each team winning three series apiece.\n\nWestern Conference first round\n(1) Utah Jazz vs. (8) Los Angeles Clippers\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Jazz winning the first meeting.\n\n(2) Seattle SuperSonics vs. (7) Phoenix Suns\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Suns winning two of the first three meetings.\n\n(3) Houston Rockets vs. (6) Minnesota Timberwolves\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Rockets and the Timberwolves.\n\n(4) Los Angeles Lakers vs. (5) Portland Trail Blazers\nThis was the seventh playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning four of the first six meetings.\n\nConference semifinals\nEastern Conference semifinals\n(1) Chicago Bulls vs. (4) Atlanta Hawks\nScottie Pippen hits the game winning 3 with 43.9 seconds remaining\n\nGame 4 was Robert Parish's final NBA game.\n\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Hawks winning two of the first three meetings.\n\n(2) Miami Heat vs. (3) New York Knicks\nPatrick Ewing blocked a last second three pointer to preserve the victory.\n\nThis game featured a fight between P.

The Bulls achieved a second three peat, a goal unrivaled since the Boston Celtics in 1966. Michael Jordan was named NBA Finals MVP for the sixth and final time.\n\nOverview\nThe Indiana Pacers entered the postseason with a franchise record 58 wins. Although they would lose to the Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference Finals, this team was later named by Pacers.com as the greatest in franchise history, even better than the 2000 team that won the Eastern Conference Title, primarily due to their record.\nThe New Jersey Nets made the playoffs for the first time since 1994, but did not appear again until 2002. Their presence was a mere asterisk compared to what they accomplished in 2002, getting swept by the eventual champion Bulls.\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves won their first playoff game in franchise history by winning Game 2 of their series against the Seattle SuperSonics. However, the SuperSonics prevailed in five games despite the Timberwolves taking a 2–1 series lead.\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers lost to Indiana in the first round 3–1 and did not appear again until 2006.\nThe Heat–Knicks series was extremely notable for two reasons\n\nGame 4: A fight broke out between Larry Johnson and Alonzo Mourning at the end of the game (in which the Knicks won 90–85). A lasting image of the fight was Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy clinging to Mourning's leg. Both players were suspended for two games. Johnson and Mourning had bad blood dating back to their stint as Charlotte Hornets teammates.\nGame 5: The New York Knicks became the fourth seventh seed to knock off a second seeded team in the first round of the playoffs. This would not occur again until 2010.\nGame 5 of the Jazz–Rockets series would be the final game of Clyde Drexler's career.\nThe Los Angeles Lakers advanced to the Western Conference Finals for the first time since 1991. They were ultimately swept by the Jazz.\nThe Eastern Conference Finals series between the Chicago Bulls and Indiana Pacers was extremely notable for several reasons\n\nGame 4: Reggie Miller's game winning 3 pointer with 0.7 seconds, which has been marked one of the greatest postseason moments in NBA History. Michael Jordan attempted a game winning 3 pointer of his own, but it rimmed out, effectively tying the series at 2–2.\nGame 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals: With a win, the Pacers took the Bulls to the limit by becoming 1 of only 2 teams to force a Game 7 in the Bulls' title years (the Knicks achieved this in 1992).\nGame 7: This was the first (and as of 2024, only) Game 7 to take place at the United Center.\nGame 7: This was the last Game 7 the Bulls would play until 2009.\nFor the first time since 1989 NBA Finals, there was a rematch of the same two teams: the Chicago Bulls and the Utah Jazz. This would not happen again until 2014.\nGame 6 of the NBA Finals was extremely notable for several reasons\n\nIn the waning moments of the game Michael Jordan made the title winning shot over Bryon Russell. This moment was marked as one of the greatest moments in NBA playoff history.\nIt was the highest rated and most watched game in NBA History, with 72 million viewers watching at least part of the game and an average of 35.9 million views.\nIt was the last Chicago Bulls postseason game until 2005 and the last involving the Michael Jordan-led Bulls.\nMichael Jordan's final NBA playoff game.\nPhil Jackson's final game as coach of the Chicago Bulls (he would go on to coach the Los Angeles Lakers two seasons later).\nAs of 2024, this remains the most recent NBA Finals game for the Chicago Bulls and the Utah Jazz.\n\nBracket\nTeams in bold advanced to the next round.

    "1999 NBA playoffs": "The 1999 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association’s 1998-99 season. The tournament concluded with the Western Conference champion San Antonio Spurs defeating the Eastern Conference champion New York Knicks 4 games to 1. Tim Duncan was named NBA Finals MVP.\nThe 1999 Playoffs are memorable in that a #8 seed (the Knicks) made it to the Finals for the only time in history until 2023, and that came after a lockout–shortened 50–game season.\n\nOverview\nThe Philadelphia 76ers and Milwaukee Bucks returned to the playoffs for the first time since 1991 (coincidentally they faced each other in the opening round that year), and it was also the 76ers’ first appearance since drafting Allen Iverson with the #1 overall pick in 1996. Iverson later led the Sixers to the 2001 NBA Finals.\nAfter spending their first thirteen seasons in Sacramento in mediocrity, with no winning record and two playoff appearances in 1986 and 1996, the Kings franchise made the first of eight consecutive playoff appearances, which included a trip to the Western Conference Finals in 2002. This was their first winning record since 1982–83, which they were based in Kansas City.\nThe Bulls, despite being defending champions, missed the playoffs for the first time since 1984 (mostly due to the second retirement of Michael Jordan and the departures of Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman). They also became the first defending champion since the 1969–70 Boston Celtics to miss the playoffs.\nWith their first round sweep of the Phoenix Suns, the Portland Trail Blazers won a playoff series for the first time since 1992, when they last made the NBA Finals.\nGame 4 of the Lakers–Rockets series was the final postseason appearance of Charles Barkley’s Hall of Fame career. It was also the final playoff game ever held at the Compaq Center.\nGame 5 of the Hawks–Pistons series is the last NBA playoff game played in a college basketball-specific arena (Georgia Tech's then-named Alexander Memorial Coliseum), and among the final NBA games played in a college basketball-specific arena. Many teams formerly played playoff games on college campuses, especially in the NBA's early days, but the increasing professionalization and ownership of arena times made the practice obsolete.\nGame 5 of the Heat–Knicks series was extremely notable for two reasons\n\nAllan Houston's series winning shot to win the game and the series. By doing so, the Knicks became only the second eighth seeded team (after the 1994 Denver Nuggets) to knock off a top seed in the playoffs. The Knicks were eventually joined by the 2007 Golden State Warriors, the 2011 Memphis Grizzlies, the 2012 Philadelphia 76ers, and the 2023 Miami Heat as one of only six eighth seeded teams to eliminate a top seeded team in the playoffs.\nIn addition, Game 5 was the last playoff game ever played at Miami Arena. The Heat continued to host regular season games there for part of the 1999–2000 season before moving to the American Airlines Arena in January 2000.\nGame 4 of the Spurs–Lakers series was the last regulation NBA game ever played in the Great Western Forum. The Lakers played a handful of preseason games leading up to the 1999–2000 season before Staples Center became the new home of the team for that season.\nWith their conference semifinals sweep of the Atlanta Hawks, the New York Knicks made the conference finals for the first time since 1994. The 1999 Knicks and the 2023 Miami Heat are the only eighth seeded teams (as of 2023) to advance past the conference semifinals. After losing to the Knicks, the Hawks did not return to the playoffs until 2008.\nThis was the last NBA postseason to feature back–to–backs in the conference semifinals until 2012.\nGame 2 of the Spurs–Trail Blazers series was notable for the San Antonio Spurs overcoming an eighteen-point deficit to win the game. The final shot, taken by Sean Elliott, completed what is called the “Memorial Day Miracle.”\nWith their Western Conference Finals sweep of the Portland Trail Blazers, the San Antonio Spurs made the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history.\nGame 5 of the Knicks–Pacers series was the last meaningful NBA game ever played at Market Square Arena.\nWith their Game 6 win over the Indiana Pacers, the New York Knicks became the first eighth seeded team to make it to the NBA Finals.\nWith their Game 2 win over the New York Knicks, the San Antonio Spurs won their 12th straight playoff game. The streak included back to back sweeps of the Lakers and Trail Blazers (who would meet in next year's Western Conference Finals). This playoff winning streak has since been beaten by the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors in 2017, although the Cavs started their streak by winning the final three games of the 2016 NBA playoffs.\nWith their Game 5 win against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden, the San Antonio Spurs became the first former ABA team to win an NBA Championship.  The Spurs finished with a 15–2 postseason record, which tied that of the 1991 Chicago Bulls, for the best postseason record at the time. Subsequently, it has been bettered by the 15–1 playoff record of the 2001 Los Angeles Lakers, and the 16–1 playoff record by the 2017 Golden State Warriors. Interestingly, both of the Spurs losses came against #8 seeded teams. Also, although the Spurs had home-court advantage throughout the playoffs, they played more road games (nine) than home games (eight), as all their series were won on the road.\nFor the first time since 1991, no series went to seven games. As of 2024, this remains the most recent NBA postseason not to feature a Game 7.\nThis is the last time an 8 seed went to the Eastern Conference finals and the last time they made it to the NBA Finals until 2023, when the Miami Heat beat the Boston Celtics in 7 games in the Eastern Conference finals, the New York Knicks in 6 games in the Eastern Conference semifinals, and the Milwaukee Bucks in 5 games the first round.\n\nBracket\nFirst round\nAll times are in Eastern Daylight Time. (UTC−04:00) If the venue is located in a different time zone, the local time is also given.\n\nEastern Conference first round\n(1) Miami Heat vs. (8) New York Knicks\nAllan Houston hit the series-winning shot with 0.8 seconds left to complete the Knicks first-round upset against the Heat. By winning the decisive Game 5, the Knicks became the first team in NBA history to defeat a top 2 seed in the First Round in consecutive seasons (coincidentally, both times were against the Heat). Conversely, the Heat became the first team in NBA history to not get past the First Round as a top 2 seed in consecutive seasons while also becoming the second #1 seed to lose a playoff series against a #8 seed in the First Round.\nGame 5 was the final playoff game played at Miami Arena.\n\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with each team winning one series apiece.\n\n(2) Indiana Pacers vs. (7) Milwaukee Bucks\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Pacers and the Bucks.\n\n(3) Orlando Magic vs. (6) Philadelphia 76ers\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Magic and the 76ers.\n\n(4) Atlanta Hawks vs. (5) Detroit Pistons\nThis was the eighth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Hawks winning four of the first seven meetings.

    "2000 NBA playoffs": "The 2000 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 1999–2000 season. The tournament concluded with the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers defeating the Eastern Conference champion Indiana Pacers four games to two. Shaquille O'Neal was named NBA Finals MVP.\nThis was also the first NBA postseason to not have any back-to-backs at all. (After 1988, they were still used in the conference semifinals.)\n\nOverview\nThe San Antonio Spurs were the champions going into the playoffs, but following a season–ending injury to third–year star Tim Duncan, were eliminated by the Phoenix Suns in the first round, marking the first time since 1987 that a new champion would follow a team enjoying a single season championship tenure. They were also the first defending champion to be eliminated in the first round since the Philadelphia 76ers in 1984.\nThe Houston Rockets missed the playoffs for the first time since 1992, while the Seattle SuperSonics returned after a one-season absence.\nThe Toronto Raptors made their NBA playoff debut, becoming the first Canadian team to do so. As such, Game 3 of their first round series against the New York Knicks was the first NBA Playoff game ever played outside the United States.\nFor the first time in franchise history, the Miami Heat swept a playoff opponent by beating the Detroit Pistons 3–0. It was also their first playoff series victory since 1997, when they made the Conference Finals.\nGame 4 of the Trail Blazers-Timberwolves series was Malik Sealy's final NBA Game. He would lose his life in on May 20, when he was driving home after attending Kevin Garnett's birthday party and a drunk driver made a wrong-way turn and crashed into Sealy's car, killing him immediately.\nIn the conference semifinals, the Miami Heat and New York Knicks met for the fourth consecutive postseason. They would not meet again in the playoffs until 2012.\nWith their conference semifinals victory over the Utah Jazz, The Portland Trail Blazers advanced to their second consecutive Western Conference Finals. The Trail Blazers would not win another playoff series until 2014.\nWith a Game 7 win in the conference semifinals, the New York Knicks eliminated the Miami Heat for the third consecutive postseason. The Knicks would not win another playoff series until 2013.\nIn the Western Conference Finals, the Los Angeles Lakers took a 3–1 series lead, only for the Portland Trail Blazers to force a Game 7. By doing so, the Trail Blazers became the first team since 1981 to force a Game 7 in the Conference Finals despite trailing 3–1.\nWith their Eastern Conference Finals victory over the New York Knicks, the Indiana Pacers won their first Eastern Conference title after four previous appearances in the Eastern Conference Finals; however, after this season, the team was radically altered with key players Dale Davis, Derrick McKey and Mark Jackson moving to other teams and Rik Smits retiring. Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals was the last game Patrick Ewing ever played as a Knick. The Pacers would not win another playoff series until 2004.\nIn Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals, the Los Angeles Lakers used a 15–0 fourth quarter run to overcome a fifteen-point deficit to defeat the Portland Trail Blazers and make their first NBA Finals since 1991. With the win, the Lakers also avoided the dubious distinction of becoming the seventh team in NBA History to lose a playoff series despite leading 3–1.\nThe Lakers' NBA Finals win over the Indiana Pacers was the first title for both Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, and the first Lakers championship since the 1988 NBA Finals. A.C. Green, the only player left from the Lakers' Showtime era, was in the Lakers starting lineup for this series as well.\n\nPlayoff qualifying\nEastern Conference\nThe following teams clinched a playoff berth in the East:\n\nIndiana Pacers – Central Division champions, Eastern Conference regular season champions (56–26)\nMiami Heat – Atlantic Division champions (52–30)\nNew York Knicks (50–32)\nCharlotte Hornets (49–33, 3–1 head-to-head vs. PHI)\nPhiladelphia 76ers (49–33, 1–3 head-to-head vs. CHA)\nToronto Raptors (45–37)\nDetroit Pistons (42–40, 3–1 head-to-head vs. MIL)\nMilwaukee Bucks (42–40, 1–3 head-to-head vs. DET)\n\nWestern Conference\nThe following teams clinched a playoff berth in the West:\n\nLos Angeles Lakers – Pacific Division champions, Western Conference regular season champions, NBA regular season champions (67–15)\nUtah Jazz – Midwest Division champions (55–27)\nPortland Trail Blazers (59–23)\nSan Antonio Spurs (53–29)\nPhoenix Suns (53–29)\nMinnesota Timberwolves (50–32)\nSeattle SuperSonics (45–37)\nSacramento Kings (44–38)\n\nBracket\nThis was the outlook for the playoffs.

    "2001 NBA playoffs": "The 2001 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 2000-01 season. The tournament concluded with the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers defeating the Eastern Conference champion Philadelphia 76ers 4 games to 1. Shaquille O'Neal was named NBA Finals MVP for the second straight year.\n\nOverview\nThe Dallas Mavericks made the playoffs for the first time since 1990. Along the way they had many abysmal seasons, including back–to–back years with 11 and 13 wins between 1993 and 1994.\nThe Los Angeles Lakers entered the postseason with an eight-game winning streak, while the Milwaukee Bucks entered the playoffs as division champions for the first time since 1986.\nFor the first time since 1997, all four late 80's expansion teams (Miami, Orlando, Charlotte, and Minnesota) made the playoffs. As of 2024, this remains the most recent occurrence of all four expansion teams making the playoffs.\nWith their series win over the Orlando Magic, the Milwaukee Bucks won their first playoff series since 1989.\nWith their 3–2 series win over the Utah Jazz in the first round, the Dallas Mavericks won their first playoff series since 1988. This also marked the first time since 1995 that the Jazz failed to advance past the first round.\nThe Sacramento Kings won their first playoff series since 1981 (when they were the Kansas City Kings) and the first since moving to Sacramento. The Toronto Raptors also won their first playoff series in franchise history with their 3–2 first round victory over the New York Knicks. They would not win another playoff series until 2016.\nFor the first time since 1991, the Knicks failed to win a first–round playoff series. Coincidentally, this also marked the first time since 1996 that the Heat and the Knicks did not meet in the playoffs as both teams were eliminated in the first round by the Charlotte Hornets and the Toronto Raptors, respectively. The Heat and the Knicks would not return to the playoffs until 2004.\n2001 also marked the closest the Charlotte Hornets came to making the Eastern Conference Finals, taking a 3–2 series lead over the Milwaukee Bucks before bowing out in seven games. As of 2024, the Hornets were one of two active teams (the other being the New Orleans Pelicans) to never advance to the Conference Finals. After eliminating the Hornets, the Milwaukee Bucks made the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 1986. For the Bucks, this was their most recent playoff series win until 2019.\nThe Western Conference Semi–Finals series between the San Antonio Spurs and Dallas Mavericks also marked the start of the Mavericks–Spurs rivalry. The Spurs would win this playoff series (along with subsequent series victories in 2003 and 2010), while the Mavericks won in 2006 and 2009. Game 4 of the series was the last NBA game ever played at Reunion Arena, as the Mavericks moved to the American Airlines Center the following season.\nWith their Western Conference Finals sweep of the San Antonio Spurs, the Lakers went 11–0 through the first three rounds, extending their winning streak to 19 games (regular season and playoffs)). The Lakers also equaled the previous records set by their 1989 team by winning their first 11 post–season games and sweeping three series in the post-season. Their playoff dominance would be bested after the first round of playoffs was extended to a best of seven format instead of the best of five in the 2003 NBA playoffs by the 2016–17 Golden State Warriors who would go 16–1 on their way to their fifth championship.\nWith their Eastern Conference Finals victory over the Milwaukee Bucks, the Philadelphia 76ers made the NBA Finals for the first time since 1983, when Moses Malone and Julius Erving led the 1983 team to the NBA title (coincidentally, last defeating the Lakers) in the famous \"fo', fo', fo'\" year (it ended up being \"fo', fi', fo'\", as Philadelphia lost one second-round game to the Milwaukee Bucks that year). With the loss, the Bucks would not return to the Conference Finals until 2019.\nGame 1 of the 2001 NBA Finals was extremely notable for two things.\n\nAllen Iverson's step over Tyronn Lue\nThe Philadelphia 76ers giving the Lakers their only loss of the postseason (107–101 in Overtime).\nWith their Game 5 win over the Philadelphia 76ers, the Los Angeles Lakers won their 13th NBA championship. With the win, the Lakers put together the most dominant postseason in NBA history, going 15–1. They set many records, including going undefeated in regulation and on the road (finishing 8–0 in the latter category).

    "2002 NBA playoffs": "The 2002 NBA playoffs were the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 2001–02 season. This was the final postseason that held a best-of-5 first-round series; the 2003 NBA playoffs saw those series expand to a best-of-7 format. The tournament concluded with the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers defeating the Eastern Conference champion New Jersey Nets 4 games to 0 in the 2002 NBA Finals. Shaquille O'Neal was named NBA Finals MVP for the third straight year.\nThe 2002 playoffs are best remembered for that year's Western Conference Finals between the two-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers and the Sacramento Kings. The matchup between the Lakers and Kings is regarded as one of the most controversial playoff series in NBA history. At the time, there was widespread criticism of the officiating as favoring the Lakers, especially in Game 6. Several years later, disgraced referee Tim Donaghy accused the Game 6 officiating crew of fixing the game, at the behest of the NBA's front office.\n\nOverview\nThe 2002 NBA Playoffs marked the return of the Boston Celtics, who had last made the playoffs in 1995. In addition, the New Jersey Nets returned to the playoffs for the first time since 1998.\nThis also marked the last appearance of the Charlotte Hornets in the playoffs until 2010. The Hornets moved the next year to New Orleans, while an expansion team, formerly the Bobcats, was formed in 2004. The Hornets were renamed the Pelicans in 2013, after which the Bobcats reclaimed the Hornets name in 2014. The Hornets also reclaimed the history and records of the 1988–2002 Charlotte teams.\nThe New York Knicks missed the playoffs for the first time since 1987, while the Miami Heat missed the playoffs for the first time since 1995. With that, Pat Riley missed the playoffs for the first time in his coaching career.  Also the Phoenix Suns missed the playoffs for the first time since 1988.\nWith their first round series win over the Philadelphia 76ers, the Boston Celtics won their first playoff series since 1992.\nWith their first round series win over the Toronto Raptors, the Detroit Pistons won their first playoff series since 1991.\nWith their first round series win over the Indiana Pacers, the New Jersey Nets won a playoff series for the first time since 1984.\nWith similar sweeps on April 28, the Minnesota Timberwolves and Portland Trail Blazers were the final teams to lose in three-game sweep; they fell to the Dallas Mavericks and Los Angeles Lakers respectively.\nGame 4 of the Nets–Hornets series was the final playoff game ever played at Charlotte Coliseum.\nGame 5 of the Lakers–Spurs series was the last NBA playoff game aired on TBS.\nWith their conference semifinals victory over the Charlotte Hornets, the New Jersey Nets made the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time in franchise history. It also marked the first time the Nets won a best of seven playoff series in franchise history.\nWith their conference semifinals victory over the Detroit Pistons, the Boston Celtics made their first Eastern Conference Finals appearance since 1988.\nIn Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals, the Boston Celtics created the biggest 4th quarter playoff comeback in Game 3, winning 94–90 after trailing by as much as 21 prior to the fourth quarter. (This record was later broken by the Los Angeles Clippers, who came back from 24 in the fourth quarter against the Memphis Grizzlies in 2012).\nWith their Game 6 win over the Boston Celtics, the New Jersey Nets made the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history, preventing a Celtics–Lakers NBA Finals.\nThe Lakers’ Game 7 win over the Sacramento Kings marked the first time since 1982 that a road team won a Game 7 in the conference finals.\nThe 2002 NBA Finals marked the first time since 1995 that a team swept an NBA Finals series.\nGame 4 of the NBA Finals was the last telecast on NBC. TBS and NBC were replaced with ESPN and ABC the following season, since both channels are owned by the Walt Disney Company. TBS has aired some NBA basketball in the ensuing years due to conflicts on sister network TNT. The total number of playoff games was 70, including the NBA Finals.\n\nBracket\nPlayoff qualifying\nWestern Conference\nBest record in NBA\nThe Sacramento Kings clinched the best record in the NBA and earned home-court advantage throughout the entire playoffs.\n\nClinched a playoff berth\nThe following teams clinched a playoff berth in the West:\n\nSacramento Kings (61–21, clinched Pacific division)\nSan Antonio Spurs (58–24, clinched Midwest division)\nLos Angeles Lakers (58–24)\nDallas Mavericks (57–25)\nMinnesota Timberwolves (50–32)\nPortland Trail Blazers (49–33)\nSeattle SuperSonics (45–37)\nUtah Jazz (44–38)\n\nEastern Conference\nBest record in conference\nThe New Jersey Nets clinched the best record in the Eastern Conference and earned home-court advantage throughout the Eastern Conference playoffs.\n\nClinched a playoff berth\nThe following teams clinched a playoff berth in the East:\n\nNew Jersey Nets (52–30, clinched Atlantic division)\nDetroit Pistons (50–32, clinched Central division)\nBoston Celtics (49–33)\nCharlotte Hornets (44–38, 3–1 head-to-head vs. ORL)\nOrlando Magic (44–38, 1–3 head-to-head vs. CHA)\nPhiladelphia 76ers (43–39)\nToronto Raptors (42–40, 3–1 head-to-head vs. IND)\nIndiana Pacers (42–40, 1–3 head-to-head vs. TOR)\n\nFirst round\nEastern Conference first round\n(1) New Jersey Nets vs. (8) Indiana Pacers\nAlthough the Nets won the series in 5, it would be most remarkable for more playoff heroics by Reggie Miller; Miller banked in a 40-footer at the buzzer to force OT, and then fly in for a dunk over 3 Net defenders with 3.1 seconds left in the extra session to force the 2nd overtime.\n\nThis was the first NBA playoff meeting between the Pacers and the Nets. As members of the ABA, both teams met in the 1972 ABA Finals, where the Pacers won 4–2.\n\n(2) Detroit Pistons vs. (7) Toronto Raptors\nThis series involved two teams that had exceeded expectations during the season. It was also the first time that professional sports teams from Detroit and Toronto met in a postseason series since the Detroit Red Wings and the Toronto Maple Leafs met in the 1993 Norris Division Semifinals, but no two teams from the two cities have met in a postseason series since.  The Detroit Pistons were coming off a year where they had lost 50 games. The Raptors had lost their star forward, Vince Carter, for the remainder of the season. As a result, the Raptors lost 13 straight games without him. Although they looked down and out of playoff contention, the Raptors went on a surge, winning 12 of their last 14 games, locking up the 7th seed. The home team won each game of the series, with the Pistons winning the decisive Game 5 by 3 points. Raptors' Guard, Chris Childs, attempted to draw a foul on a three-point shot, instead of passing it to an open Dell Curry. In the post game interview, Childs stated that he thought the team was down by four points, not three. Detroit advanced to face the Boston Celtics in the second round. Meanwhile, Toronto, with a 39 year old Hakeem Olajuwon playing his final game, was on the couch.\n\nGame 5 is Hakeem Olajuwon's final NBA game.\n\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Pistons and the Raptors.\n\n(3) Boston Celtics vs. (6) Philadelphia 76ers\nThis series marked the return of the Celtics to the playoffs for the first time in seven years, and they faced the reigning Eastern Conference champion in the first round. The first two games were played in Boston, where the Celtics won both games resoundingly. The 76ers fought back, however, and with Allen Iverson scoring 42 points the 76ers won Game 3 and stayed alive. In Game 4, Iverson was slowed down, scoring 26 points on just 9-of-26 shooting, and Antoine Walker stepped up for the Celtics, scoring 25. But Iverson's play at the end making a layup, scoring off an Eric Snow steal, and hitting some free throws after Walker drilled a three sealed the victory for the 76ers. This set the stage for a Game 5 in Boston to decide the series. The Celtics had control on this game throughout, but the 76ers kept within striking distance into the 4th quarter. But Boston went on an amazing streak of three-pointers, hitting an NBA playoff record nine of them in the 4th quarter and 19 in the game. Paul Pierce led the way with 46, on 8-10 shooting from downtown, and Boston won in a huge blowout, sending them to the conference semifinals to face second-seed Detroit.\n\nThis was the 19th playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Celtics winning 10 of the first 18 meetings.\n\n(4) Charlotte Hornets vs. (5) Orlando Magic\nGame 4 is Patrick Ewing's final NBA game.\n\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Magic and the Charlotte Hornets/Bobcats franchise.\n\nWestern Conference first round\n(1) Sacramento Kings vs. (8) Utah Jazz\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Jazz winning the first meeting.\n\n(2) San Antonio Spurs vs. (7) Seattle SuperSonics\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Spurs winning the first meeting.\n\n(3) Los Angeles Lakers vs. (6) Portland Trail Blazers\nThe Lakers sweep the Blazers thanks to a series-winning 3 by Robert Horry with 2.1 seconds left in Game 3.\n\nThis was the 11th playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning eight of the first ten meetings.\n\n(4) Dallas Mavericks vs. (5) Minnesota Timberwolves\nDirk Nowitzki was virtually unstoppable in this series, averaging 33 points and 16 rebounds per game.\n\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Mavericks and the Timberwolves.\n\nConference semifinals\nEastern Conference semifinals\n(1) New Jersey Nets vs. (4) Charlotte Hornets\nGame 4 would not only be the last game played at Charlotte Coliseum until 2004 when the Charlotte Bobcats were an expansion team (the Bobcats would make the first of their two only playoff appearances in 2010), but the last playoff game ever played at the arena. Game 5 would also be the Hornets' last playoff game before moving to New Orleans and then being renewed in 2014. They would make the playoffs again in 2016.\n\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Nets and the Hornets.\n\n(2) Detroit Pistons vs. (3) Boston Celtics\nThis was the seventh playoff meeting between these two teams, with each team winning three series apiece.\n\nWestern Conference semifinals\n(1) Sacramento Kings vs. (4) Dallas Mavericks\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Mavericks and the Kings.\n\n(2) San Antonio Spurs vs. (3) Los Angeles Lakers\nThe Spurs led going into the fourth quarter of four out of the five games, yet were able to win only one. Bryant would pace Los Angeles to 2 crucial victories in the Alamodome with 31 points in Game 3 and a game-winning bucket in Game 4, and would offset the steady production of Tim Duncan (who had a double double in every game including 34 points and 25 rebounds in Game 5) with his fourth quarter heroics. It would be San Antonio's final 2 home games in the Alamodome, as they would move into the SBC Center (now the Frost Bank Center) the following year.\n\nThis was the eighth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning five of the first seven meetings.\n\nConference finals\nEastern Conference finals\n(1) New Jersey Nets vs. (3) Boston Celtics\nThe Nets won game one, but Boston came back to steal game two in New Jersey to send the series back to Boston tied 1-1. In Game 3, the Celtics were down by as much as 26 points (21 coming into the 4th quarter), but they accomplished the biggest comeback in NBA Playoff history as the Celtics outscored the Nets 41–16 in the fourth quarter. The Celtics almost completed another comeback in game four, but the Nets held on for the victory to tie the series at two games apiece. The Nets won games five and six to advance to the team's first of two consecutive NBA Finals.\n\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Celtics and the Nets.\n\nWestern Conference finals\n(1) Sacramento Kings vs. (3) Los Angeles Lakers\nThe 2002 Western Conference finals is widely regarded as one of the best series in NBA playoff history, with the last four games coming down to the final seconds. Two games were decided on game winning shots and Game 7 was decided in overtime. However, the series was marred by controversy and allegations of corruption. On June 10, 2008, convicted NBA referee Tim Donaghy's attorney filed a court document alleging that Game 6 was fixed by two referees. The letter states that Donaghy \"learned from Referee A that Referees A and F wanted to extend the series to seven games. Tim knew Referees A and F to be 'company men', always acting in the interest of the NBA, and that night, it was in the NBA's interest to add another game to the series.\" The Lakers won Game 6 106–102, attempting 18 more free throws than the Kings in the fourth quarter, and went on to win the series, and eventually the NBA championship. The document claimed that Donaghy told federal agents that in order to increase television ratings and ticket sales, \"top executives of the NBA sought to manipulate games using referees\". It also said that NBA officials would tell referees to not call technical fouls on certain players, and states that a referee was privately reprimanded by the league for ejecting a star player in the first quarter of a January 2000 game. Stern denied the accusations, calling Donaghy a \"singing, cooperating witness\".\nThe Lakers and Kings split the first two games in Sacramento. Los Angeles raced out to a 36-point first quarter in Game 1 behind 67% shooting and never trailed, paced by Kobe Bryant's 30 point effort and 26 points from Shaquille O'Neal. Chris Webber had 28 points and 14 rebounds, but the other Kings combined shot under 40 percent. Sacramento rebounded to win Game 2, paced behind Webber (21 points, 13 rebounds) and Mike Bibby (20 points). O'Neal had 35 points and 13 rebounds, but struggled with foul trouble; Bryant shot 9-for-21 from the field and was suffering from food poisoning which he contracted from a meal at the team hotel, and some felt it was done deliberately by the hotel staff. The loss snapped the NBA record 12-game playoff road winning streak for the Lakers.\nThe Kings went to Staples Center and dominated Game 3 to regain home-court advantage, leading by as many as 27 and never trailing. They were again paced by Webber and Bibby, who combined for 50 points, and got solid contributions from Doug Christie (17 points, 12 rebounds, 6 assists, 3 steals) and Vlade Divac (11 points, 9 rebounds and 3 blocks). Other than a brief 3-point barrage in the 4th quarter by the Lakers to cut the lead to 12, there was not much help provided for O'Neal, who had 20 points and 19 rebounds.\nIn Game 4, Sacramento again got out to a fast start with a 40-point first quarter and built a 24-point first half lead. However, the Lakers cut the lead to 14 at halftime with a Samaki Walker 3-pointer at the buzzer that should not have counted (replay was not used at the time), and to 7 after three quarters. They whittled it down to 2 on the final possession with a chance to tie or win it, but Bryant missed a running layup and Shaq missed a put-back attempt. Divac knocked the ball away from the hoop in an attempt to run out the clock, but instead it wound up going to a wide open Robert Horry behind the 3 point line, who hit the 3 over Webber at the buzzer to give the Lakers an improbable victory, which tied the series going back to Sacramento. Horry scored 11 of his 18 points in the 4th quarter, including two more crucial 3-pointers. O'Neal finished with 27 points and 18 rebounds, Bryant had 25. Divac, Webber and Bibby all finished with 20+ points for the Kings.\nAs the series shifted back to Sacramento for Game 5, the Kings trailed almost the entire fourth quarter, but a jump shot by Bibby off a screen with 8.2 seconds left gave them the lead and was the game-winner in a 92–91 win. Bibby scored 23 in all, and Webber had 29 points and 13 rebounds in support. Bryant led Los Angeles with 30 points, but missed a potential game winner at the buzzer. O'Neal had 28 points, but did not take a shot in the 4th quarter and fouled out.\nGame 6 is considered to be one of the most controversial games in not just NBA history, but arguably all of North American professional sports history, as numerous questionable calls went against the Kings in the fourth quarter. The Lakers, led by O'Neal's 41 points and 17 rebounds, won 106–102, setting the stage for Game 7 in Sacramento. There are allegations that the game was affected by the referees in relationship to the Tim Donaghy scandal. The Lakers shot 40 free throws overall, 27 in the fourth quarter alone, and the Kings' big men were plagued with foul trouble (Divac, Webber, Scot Pollard, and Lawrence Funderburke were called for 20 fouls, with Divac and Pollard both fouling out). Webber nearly had a triple double (26 points, 13 rebounds and 8 assists), Bibby scored 23, and Divac had 12 points and 12 rebounds. The Washington Post sports columnist Michael Wilbon responded to the calls in Game 6: \"I wrote down in my notebook six calls that were stunningly incorrect, all against Sacramento, all in the fourth quarter when the Lakers made five baskets and 21 foul shots to hold on to their championship.\" For example, Wilbon pointed out that Kobe Bryant did not get a foul called on him after elbowing Mike Bibby in front of an official.\nGame 7 was tense, featuring 16 ties and 19 lead changes. In the final ten seconds with Los Angeles up 99–98, Peja Stojaković air-balled a wide open 3, and O'Neal was fouled on the rebound. After O'Neal hit 1 of 2 free throws, Bibby was fouled by Bryant and made both free throws to force overtime. The Kings' offense stalled in the extra period, and the Lakers prevailed 112–106. Sacramento was undone by poor free throw shooting (16–30 from the line), a horrid 2–20 from behind the arc, and a seeming unwillingness for anyone other than Bibby to take crucial shots down the stretch. O'Neal scored 35 and Bryant added 30 in the victory, as all five Lakers starters finished in double figures. Bibby finished with 29 points, and Webber finished with 20 points, 11 rebounds, and 8 assists. Divac added 15 points and 10 rebounds.\nThis would be the last Western Conference finals to be decided in seven games until 2016.\nAnnouncers: for NBC, Mike Breen announced Game 1, Marv Albert Games 3–7; Bill Walton & Steve Jones joined them as the analysts. TNT had Kevin Harlan, Danny Ainge, & John Thompson on hand for Game 2.\n\nThis was the tenth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning eight of the first nine meetings.\n\nNBA Finals (W3) Los Angeles Lakers vs. (E1) New Jersey Nets\nIn Game 1, the Nets stayed within striking distance, but Shaquille O'Neal's 36 points and 16 rebounds led the Lakers to victory. In Game 2, the Nets were blown out by 23, with O'Neal leading the way again, putting up 40 points and 12 rebounds and coming within 2 assists of a triple double. This brought the series to New Jersey with the Lakers up 2–0. Game 3 was a close matchup with Jason Kidd, Kenyon Martin, O'Neal, and Kobe Bryant all scoring 26 or more points. Bryant and O'Neal's combined 71 points was too much for the Nets to handle though, and the Lakers took a 3–0 series lead. In Game 4, O'Neal put up 34 points and the Lakers won the game and the championship, accomplishing the NBA's second three-peat in seven years. Game 4 is Mitch Richmond's final NBA game. Game 4 was also, as of 2025, the last NBA game to be televised on NBC.\n\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Nets and the Lakers.\n\nStatistical leaders\nSee also\nNBA records\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nNBA.com's 2002 Playoffs coverage",
    "2003 NBA playoffs": "The 2003 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 2002–03 season. The tournament concluded with the Western Conference champion San Antonio Spurs defeating the Eastern Conference champion New Jersey Nets, 4 games to 2, in the NBA Finals. Tim Duncan was named NBA Finals MVP for the second time.\n\nOverview\nThe 2003 Playoffs were notable for several reasons.\n\nThis postseason featured the most series decided by six games in NBA playoff history. (Coincidentally, the Spurs won every single playoff series in six games en route to the championship.)\nFor the first time since 1974, all series were conducted in a best-of-seven format. From 1984 to 2002, the first-round series were best of five. It is also notable as the only time the first round did not include any series sweeps.\nThis is the first postseason that the NBA Playoffs carried more games on cable television than regular broadcast television, and marks the debut for the NBA Playoffs to be aired on NBA TV, and the return broadcast on ESPN and ABC after the NBA departed from NBC and TBS.\nThis was the final postseason appearance for David Robinson, Steve Kerr, Shawn Kemp and John Stockton\nDespite relocating to New Orleans in the offseason, the Hornets made their third consecutive postseason. After Charlotte reclaimed the Hornets name and pre-2002–03 history in 2014 (and the Pelicans claimed the Hornets' history from 2002–03 onwards), this marked the first postseason for the New Orleans franchise.\nThe Portland Trail Blazers and Utah Jazz continued the longest active Western Conference playoff appearance streaks at the time, entering their 21st and 20th postseason appearances, respectively.\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves entered their seventh consecutive postseason. In addition, they were awarded home-court advantage for the first time in franchise history in their series against the Los Angeles Lakers.\nThe Orlando Magic became the seventh team to lose a playoff series despite leading 3–1, losing to the Detroit Pistons in the first round. The Magic would not win another playoff game again until 2008.\nGame 5 of the Kings–Jazz series was the final game featuring Karl Malone and John Stockton as members of the Utah Jazz. Stockton would retire after the season while Malone would sign with the Lakers in the offseason. After this, the Jazz would not return to the playoffs until 2007.\nWith their first-round series loss to the Los Angeles Lakers, the Minnesota Timberwolves earned the dubious distinction of making their first seven postseason appearances, only to lose in the first round. They would break that streak by winning their first playoff series the following postseason.\nThe Portland Trail Blazers snapped a ten-game playoff losing streak dating back to 2000 with a Game 4 win in their first-round series against the Dallas Mavericks. The Trail Blazers also became the third team in NBA History to force a Game 7 after trailing 0–3 before bowing out. They would not return to the playoffs until 2009.\nWith their conference semifinals loss to the New Jersey Nets, the Boston Celtics were swept in a postseason series for the first time since 1983, and would not return to the Conference Semifinals until 2008.\nWith their conference semifinals loss to the San Antonio Spurs, the Lakers' championship streak was snapped at 3. With the win, the Spurs returned to the Western Conference Finals for the third time in five seasons.\nWith their conference semifinals win over the Philadelphia 76ers, the Detroit Pistons advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since the Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars-led team was swept by the Chicago Bulls in 1991. The Pistons would go on to appear in six consecutive Eastern Conference Finals through 2008, the most consecutive appearances for any Eastern Conference team since the Bill Russell-led Boston Celtics (1956–69).\nWith their conference semifinals victory over the Sacramento Kings, the Dallas Mavericks made the conference finals for the first time since 1988.\nThis was the first Western Conference Finals since 1995 to take place entirely in the state of Texas.\nWith their Eastern Conference Finals sweep of the Detroit Pistons, the New Jersey Nets won ten straight postseason games, the most since the 2001 Los Angeles Lakers.\nIn Game 6 of the Spurs–Mavericks series, Steve Kerr and Manu Ginóbili sparked a 42–15 run to help the Spurs advance to the NBA Finals for the first time since 1999. The Mavericks would not return to the Conference Finals (let alone face the Spurs in the playoffs) until 2006.\nAs of 2024, the 49–win New Jersey Nets are the most recent NBA Finals participant to win fewer than 50 games in an 82–game season. Four teams have since made the Finals with sub-50 win records, but each of those times, the season was shorter than 82 games for particular reasons:\n\nThe Miami Heat (46–20) and the Oklahoma City Thunder (47–19) both made the 2012 Finals, but the 2011–12 season was shortened to 66 games due to the 2011 NBA lockout.\nThe Miami Heat (44–29) made the Finals in the 2019–20 season, but that season was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic and no team played a full 82-game schedule.\nThe Milwaukee Bucks (46–26) made it to the Finals in the 2020–21 season, however that season was only 72 games long due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPlayoff qualifying\nWestern Conference\nEastern Conference\nBracket\nFirst round\nEastern Conference first round\n(1) Detroit Pistons vs. (8) Orlando Magic\nThe Pistons became the 7th team in NBA history to overcome a 3–1 series deficit and the first 1st seed to do so.\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Magic winning the first meeting.\n\n(2) New Jersey Nets vs. (7) Milwaukee Bucks\nIn Game 3, Rodney Rogers hit the game winner with 2 seconds left.\n\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Bucks winning the first two meetings.\n\n(3) Indiana Pacers vs. (6) Boston Celtics\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Celtics winning the first two meetings.\n\n(4) Philadelphia 76ers vs. (5) New Orleans Hornets\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the 76ers and the New Orleans Pelicans/Hornets franchise.\n\nWestern Conference first round\n(1) San Antonio Spurs vs. (8) Phoenix Suns\nIn Game 1, after Amar'e Stoudemire banks in a game-tying 3 with 7.9 seconds left in regulation, Stephon Marbury hits the game-winning 3 at the buzzer in OT.\n\nThis was the sixth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Suns winning three of the first five meetings.\n\n(2) Sacramento Kings vs. (7) Utah Jazz\nGame 5 was John Stockton's final NBA game.

    "2004 NBA playoffs": "The 2004 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 2003–04 season. The tournament concluded with the Eastern Conference champion Detroit Pistons defeating the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers four games to one in the NBA Finals. Chauncey Billups was named NBA Finals MVP.\n\nOverview\nThe 2004 playoffs was the first appearance for the Memphis Grizzlies in their nine-year history which began in Vancouver. However, they failed to win a single game in their first 3 playoff appearances (2004, 2005, 2006), before earning their first playoff game and series victories in 2011.\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves, entered their eighth consecutive post season.\nThe Denver Nuggets made the playoffs for the first time since 1995.\nThe New Orleans Hornets made their final postseason appearance as a member of the East. They would not make the playoffs again until 2008, as a member of the West (the result of a realignment with the addition of the Charlotte Bobcats in the 2004–05 NBA season). Their playoff series with the Miami Heat, led by Dwyane Wade, was the last playoff series where the home team won all seven games until 2008's Boston–Atlanta and Boston–Cleveland playoff series.\nThe Houston Rockets made playoffs for the first time since 1999. As a result, 2004 was the first time in 14 years that all Texas teams made the playoffs, and the second time (first in ten years) that all former ABA teams made the playoffs. This was Steve Francis' only career playoff appearance.\nThis was the first postseason since 1998 without Allen Iverson or Tracy McGrady.\nThe Miami Heat and the New York Knicks both made the playoffs for the first time since 2001. This marked Dwyane Wade's first postseason appearance and the start of four straight playoff appearances for the Heat. For the Knicks, on the other hand, this was their last appearance until 2011.\nThe Portland Trail Blazers and Utah Jazz missed the playoffs for the first time since 1982 and 1983, respectively.\nGame 4 of the Spurs–Grizzlies series was the last NBA game ever played at Pyramid Arena. That game and Game 3 of the same series were the only playoff games to take place in The Pyramid before the Grizzlies moved to FedExForum in the autumn of 2004.\nWith their series win over the Denver Nuggets, the Minnesota Timberwolves won their first playoff series in franchise history.\nWith their first round series loss to the Sacramento Kings, the Dallas Mavericks lost a first round playoff series for the first time since 1990. As of 2024, this remains the Kings’ most recent series victory.\nGame 5 of the Lakers–Spurs series was extremely notable for both teams’ last shots. Tim Duncan scored a two–pointer to give the Spurs a 73–72 lead with 0.4 seconds remaining. However, Derek Fisher would hit the game winning shot as time expired to give the Lakers a 74–73 victory in San Antonio.\nWith their conference semifinals victory over the Miami Heat, the Indiana Pacers made the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since their NBA Finals run in 2000, after which they significantly changed the makeup of their team (yet still made the playoffs every year).\nWith their conference semifinals victory over the Sacramento Kings, the Minnesota Timberwolves made their first conference finals appearance in franchise history. They didn't return to the conference finals until 2024.\nGame 2 of the Pistons–Pacers series was notable for Tayshaun Prince's block of Reggie Miller's late game layup.\nGame 6 of the Timberwolves–Lakers series was the last Minnesota Timberwolves postseason game until 2018.\nWith their Conference Finals win over the Indiana Pacers, the Detroit Pistons made the NBA Finals for the first time since 1990.\nIn a shocking upset, the Detroit Pistons beat the Los Angeles Lakers in five games to win the NBA Championship.\n\nPlayoff qualifying\nEastern Conference\nBest record in NBA\nThe Indiana Pacers clinched the best record in the NBA and had earned home court advantage throughout the entire playoffs. However, when Indiana lost to the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals, home court advantage for the NBA Finals switched to the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers, who had posted a better regular season record at 56–26 than the Eastern Conference champion Detroit Pistons at 54–28.\n\nClinched a playoff berth\nThe following teams clinched a playoff berth in the East:\n\nIndiana Pacers (61–21) (clinched Central division)\nNew Jersey Nets (47–35) (clinched Atlantic division)\nDetroit Pistons (54–28)\nMiami Heat (42–40)\nNew Orleans Hornets (41–41, 3–1 head-to-head vs. MIL)\nMilwaukee Bucks (41–41, 1–3 head-to-head vs. NOH)\nNew York Knicks (39–43)\nBoston Celtics (36–46)\n\nWestern Conference\nBest record in conference\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves clinched the best record in the Western Conference and had home court advantage throughout the Western Conference playoffs.

    "2005 NBA playoffs": "The 2005 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 2004–05 season. The tournament concluded with the Western Conference champion San Antonio Spurs defeating the Eastern Conference champion Detroit Pistons 4 games to 3 in the NBA Finals. Tim Duncan was named Finals MVP.\n\nOverview\nThe Chicago Bulls and Washington Wizards ended long playoff droughts in 2005, meeting each other in the first round. For the Washington Wizards, it was their first playoff appearance since 1997 — even more ironic their opponents for that postseason appearance were the Bulls who swept them on their way to their fifth NBA title. For the Chicago Bulls, it was their first post-Michael Jordan playoff appearance, as their last playoff game was Game 6 of the 1998 NBA Finals. They consistently placed at or near the bottom of the Central Division in between, and their 47–35 season in 2005 was a 24–game improvement from 2004.\nThe Phoenix Suns returned to the NBA playoffs after a one season absence. The Houston Rockets and the Memphis Grizzlies entered their second consecutive postseason.\nFor the Los Angeles Lakers, it marked the first time in 11 seasons (dating back to 1994) and the fifth time in NBA history that they missed the playoffs. This was thus the last time until 2018 that the playoffs would be played entirely outside of Los Angeles. The Minnesota Timberwolves missed the playoffs for the first time since 1996.\nThis was the last time that the Seattle SuperSonics would be in the playoffs before they relocated to Oklahoma to become the Oklahoma City Thunder.\nFor the third straight year (fifth overall) the Pacers met the Celtics in the first round. Boston won in 2003 4–2, while Indiana swept Boston in 2004. This time, Indiana won 4–3. It would be Boston's last playoff appearance until 2008.\nWith their first round series win over the Chicago Bulls, the Washington Wizards won their first playoff series since 1982, and first playoff game since 1988. They also won a best of seven series for the first time since 1979. With their first round sweep of the Memphis Grizzlies, the Phoenix Suns won their first playoff series since 2000.\nWith their conference semifinals sweep of the Washington Wizards, the Miami Heat became the first team to go 8–0 through the first two rounds after the first round was made into a best-of-7 in the 2003 playoffs. The 2009 Cavaliers, 2010 Magic, 2012 Spurs, 2016 Cavaliers, 2017 Cavaliers and the 2017 Warriors followed suit. No team (until 2016) has made the finals after going 8–0 in the first two rounds, let alone win 12 straight games going to the NBA Finals (until the 2017 Warriors), though the Spurs came close in 2012 when they won their first 10 playoff games, then lost their next four to the Oklahoma City Thunder. In 2016, the Cleveland Cavaliers became the first team to go 8–0 through the first two rounds and make the NBA Finals.\nWith their conference semifinals victory over the Dallas Mavericks, the Phoenix Suns advanced to the Western Conference Finals for the first time since 1993, where they lost to the San Antonio Spurs in five games.\nGame 6 of the Spurs–SuperSonics series was the last NBA Playoff game ever played at Key Arena.\nWith their Game 7 win over the Miami Heat, the Detroit Pistons advanced to their second consecutive NBA Finals.\nThe NBA Finals marked the first time since 1987 that the two previous champions met in the Finals (the Spurs won in 2003, the Pistons in 2004).\nThe NBA Finals went to a Game 7 for the first time since 1994.\nWith their Game 7 win over the Detroit Pistons, the San Antonio Spurs won the NBA Championship. For the Spurs, it was their third title (they also won in the lockout–shortened season of 1998–99).\n\nFormat\nBeginning with the 2004–05 season, with the addition of the 30th NBA franchise, the Charlotte Bobcats, the NBA realigned its divisions. Each conference now has three divisions of five teams each, and at this point in time, the winner of each division was guaranteed a top three playoff seed, regardless of whether the team had one of the top eight records in its conference. However, the division champion was not guaranteed home court advantage; a division-leading team with a poor record could be ranked number three but face a sixth seed with a better record, which would then have home court advantage. This has since been rectified by the NBA.\n\nPlayoff qualifying\nEastern Conference\nBest record in conference\nThe Miami Heat clinched the best record in the Eastern Conference, and had home court advantage throughout the Eastern Conference playoffs.\n\nClinched a playoff berth\nThe following teams clinched a playoff berth in the East:\n\nMiami Heat (59–23) (clinched Southeast division)\nDetroit Pistons (54–28) (clinched Central division)\nBoston Celtics (45–37) (clinched Atlantic division)\nChicago Bulls (47–35)\nWashington Wizards (45–37)\nIndiana Pacers (44–38)\nPhiladelphia 76ers (43–39)\nNew Jersey Nets (42–40)\n\nWestern Conference\nBest record in NBA\nThe Phoenix Suns clinched the best record in the NBA, and earned home court advantage throughout the entire playoffs.

    "2006 NBA playoffs": "The 2006 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 2005–06 season. The tournament concluded with the Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat defeating the Western Conference champion Dallas Mavericks 4 games to 2 in the NBA Finals.  Dwyane Wade was named NBA Finals MVP.\n\nOverview\nThis season was the last time that the Sacramento Kings made the playoffs until 2023. The Kings held the longest playoff drought in NBA playoff history at 16 years. With the MLB's Seattle Mariners qualifying for the playoffs in 2022, the Kings held the title for the longest active playoff drought among the four major North American sports leagues until 2023.\nThe Los Angeles Clippers made the playoffs for the first time since 1997, and advanced to the second round for the first time since 1976, when they were the Buffalo Braves. They came within one game of making the conference finals for the first time, but lost Game 7 to the Suns.\nThe Phoenix Suns became the eighth team to win a playoff series despite trailing 3–1 with their first round victory over the Los Angeles Lakers. They lost to the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference finals.\nThe Denver Nuggets also appeared in the playoffs as the 3rd seed in the Western Conference despite a 44–38 record (due to winning their division). However, they lost to the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round, and the NBA changed how division winners are seeded starting the following season.\n2006 was the playoff debut of LeBron James, who helped the Cleveland Cavaliers eke out 1–point OT victories over the Washington Wizards in Games 5 and 6 of their first-round series to advance. It was the Cavaliers first playoff appearance since 1998, and they earned their first playoff series win since 1993. The Cavaliers played against the two-time defending Eastern Conference champion Detroit Pistons in the next round.  After being routed in Game 1 and losing Game 2 by 6, the Cavs won the next three matches in a row, and they were 1 game away from beating the Pistons. However, Detroit recovered and won the last 2, in order to take the series in 7. The Pistons and Cavaliers met in the next year's Playoffs, and the Cavaliers won that series in six games. This was the last time that the Pistons beat the Cavaliers in a playoff series, as of 2024.\nThis season also marked the first time that two 60–win teams met before the conference finals, due to the seeding format. The San Antonio Spurs and the Dallas Mavericks played against each other in the Western Conference semifinals. The Mavericks won the series in seven games, marking the first time the Mavericks beat the Spurs in a playoff series.\nThis year's NBA Finals also featured a number of firsts\n\nBoth NBA Finalists made their first NBA Finals: The Dallas Mavericks and the Miami Heat, for the first time since 1971.\nNeither the Lakers nor the Spurs represented the Western Conference, for the first time since 1998.\nFor the first time since 1998, the NBA Finals did not feature Tim Duncan or Kobe Bryant (although Kobe's ex–teammate, Shaquille O'Neal, returned to the Finals for the fifth time in seven seasons)\nFor the first time since 2001, neither the Nets or the Pistons represented the Eastern Conference (coincidentally, these two teams were eliminated by the Miami Heat en route to their first Finals appearance)\nThe Mavericks became the first team since 1977 to lose the NBA Finals despite leading 2–0. They also became the first team in NBA History to win the first two games, build a double digit lead in game 3, lose game 3, and the rest of the series.\nThe Miami Heat won their first NBA Championship despite losing the first two games, the third team in NBA History to do so.\nPrior to Game 6, Pat Riley motivated his players to pack \"one shirt, one suit, one tie.\" His effort paid off, and the Heat won that game, giving Riley his fifth NBA Championship as a head coach. He also avenged his previous NBA Finals loss in 1994, when his New York Knicks lost to the Houston Rockets despite leading 3–2.\nThe 2006 NBA Playoffs also featured several lasts.\n\nGame 6 of the Spurs–Kings series was the last NBA Playoff game to be played at ARCO Arena.\nThe last time division winners were automatically granted a top three seed in the NBA Playoffs.\nThe Indiana Pacers and Memphis Grizzlies' last playoff appearance until 2011.\nThe last time the Chicago Bulls lost a first–round series following their 1998 championship.\nThe last time the Los Angeles Clippers won a playoff series until 2012 (and earned home court advantage until 2013).\nThe last time Shaquille O'Neal played in the NBA Finals.\n\nFormat\nWith the addition of the 30th NBA franchise, the Charlotte Bobcats, in 2005, the NBA realigned its divisions. Each conference had three divisions of five teams each, and at this point in time, the winner of each division was guaranteed a top-three playoff seed regardless of whether the team had one of the top-eight records in its conference. However, the division champion was not guaranteed home-court advantage; a division-leading team could be seeded second or third but face a lower seed (that did not win its division) with a better record, and the lower seed would have home-court advantage.\nThis was illustrated in the first round here when the 44-win Denver Nuggets won the Northwest Division and had the third seed, yet did not have home-court advantage against the sixth-seeded, 47-win Los Angeles Clippers. The Clippers had played the Memphis Grizzlies a week before the playoffs to determine the fifth and sixth seed. The loser of the game would face Denver, whereas the winner would face fourth-seeded Dallas, who had the second-best record in the conference. It was speculated that the Clippers lost on purpose to play Denver in the first round. Starting in the 2007 playoffs, being a division winner did not guarantee a top-3 playoff seed.\n\nPlayoff qualifying\nEastern Conference\nBest record in NBA\nThe Detroit Pistons clinched the best record in the NBA, earning home-court advantage throughout the playoffs. However, when the Pistons lost to the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference finals, home-court advantage in the NBA Finals went to the Western Conference champion Dallas Mavericks, which had a better record than the Heat.\n\nClinched a playoff berth\nThe following teams clinched a playoff berth in the East:\n\nDetroit Pistons (64–18) (clinched Central division)\nMiami Heat (52–30) (clinched Southeast division)\nNew Jersey Nets (49–33) (clinched Atlantic division)\nCleveland Cavaliers (50–32)\nWashington Wizards (42–40)\nIndiana Pacers (41–41, 2–2 head-to-head vs. CHI, 6–10 record vs. Central Division)\nChicago Bulls (41–41, 2–2 head-to-head vs. IND, 4–12 record vs. Central Division)\nMilwaukee Bucks (40–42)\n\nWestern Conference\nBest record in conference\nThe San Antonio Spurs clinched the best record in the Western Conference, and had home-court advantage throughout the Western Conference playoffs. However, when they lost to the Dallas Mavericks in the Conference semifinals, Dallas had home court advantage in the Western Conference finals.\n\nClinched a playoff berth\nThe following teams clinched a playoff berth in the West:\n\nSan Antonio Spurs (63–19) (clinched Southwest division)\nPhoenix Suns (54–28) (clinched Pacific division)\nDenver Nuggets (44–38) (clinched Northwest division)\nDallas Mavericks (60–22)\nMemphis Grizzlies (49–33)\nLos Angeles Clippers (47–35)\nLos Angeles Lakers (45–37)\nSacramento Kings (44–38)\n\nBracket\nTV coverage\nFirst and second-round games were televised on ABC, TNT, ESPN, ESPN2, and NBA TV in the United States and on TSN, The Score, and Raptors NBA TV in Canada; some games were also televised on local or regional TV networks.

They came off a playoff series win vs the Wizards, while the Pistons came in off a 4–1 win vs the 8th seeded Bucks. Detroit was expected to win the series, and took a commanding two games to none lead with two wins at the Palace of Auburn Hills. James and the Cavaliers weren't intimidated however, and won their two home games to tie the series at 2. Coming into Game 5, both teams were confident, but the Pistons were expected to pull out the win easily. The game was low scoring throughout as usual in this series, with Cleveland holding a 68–66 lead through 3 quarters. With the game tied at 84 with 26 seconds left in regulation, Drew Gooden came through and hit a layup to give Cleveland the lead that they never squandered. James led the Cavs with 32 and this brought the series to Cleveland up 3–2, quite shockingly. In the final minute of Game 6, Richard Hamilton grabbed two offensive rebounds and passed the ball to Rasheed Wallace, who was fouled.

    "2007 NBA playoffs": "The 2007 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 2006–07 season. The tournament concluded with the Western Conference champion San Antonio Spurs defeating the Eastern Conference champion Cleveland Cavaliers 4 games to 0 in the NBA Finals. Tony Parker was named NBA Finals MVP, making him the second Spur after Tim Duncan and the first European–born player to receive the award.\n\nOverview\nThe Dallas Mavericks entered their seventh consecutive postseason. In addition, the Mavericks started the playoffs with a league best 67–15 regular season record, the best in franchise history. The Mavericks also became the first team since 2000 to finish the regular season with 65+ wins. Their in-state rivals, the San Antonio Spurs, entered their tenth consecutive postseason.\nThe defending champion Miami Heat entered the playoffs for the fourth consecutive season. Despite winning their third consecutive Southeast Division title, the Heat opened the playoffs on the road against the Chicago Bulls (thanks to the Bulls’ 49–33 record versus the Heat's 44–38 record), marking the second consecutive postseason that a division winner opened the playoffs on the road. This was also Pat Riley's final NBA playoff appearance as a head coach, as the Heat would miss the playoffs the following season.\nThe Houston Rockets returned to the playoffs after a one-season absence, and opened the playoffs at home for the first time since 1997. This would also be Jeff Van Gundy's last postseason appearance as a head coach. Their first round opponent, the Northwest Division leading Utah Jazz made the playoffs for the first time since 2003. Like the Heat, the Jazz opened their postseason on the road.\nThe New Jersey Nets and the Detroit Pistons entered their sixth consecutive postseason.\nThe Denver Nuggets entered their fourth consecutive postseason.\nThe Washington Wizards, Chicago Bulls, and Phoenix Suns entered their third consecutive postseason.\nThe Los Angeles Lakers entered their second consecutive postseason.\nThe Golden State Warriors made the NBA Playoffs for the first time since 1994 NBA playoffs.\nThe Toronto Raptors made the playoffs for the first time since 2002 and earned home-court advantage for the first time in franchise history.\nThe Orlando Magic made the playoffs for the first time since 2003.\nThe Indiana Pacers missed the playoffs for the first time since 1997, while the Sacramento Kings missed the playoffs for the first time since 1998. This also marked the first of sixteen consecutive postseasons not to feature the Sacramento Kings.\n\nFirst Round\nThe Nets–Raptors series was notable for Nets guard Vince Carter facing his former team, the Toronto Raptors. His New Jersey Nets won the series in six games, giving the Raptors their second consecutive first round exit. The Nets would not win another playoff series until 2014 as the Brooklyn Nets, which was also against the Raptors.\nWith their first round sweep of the Orlando Magic, the Detroit Pistons swept a playoff series for the first time since 1990. It was also the Pistons’ first sweep of a best of seven series since the 1989 NBA Finals.\nWith their first round sweep of the defending champion Miami Heat, the Chicago Bulls won their first playoff series since 1998 and swept a best of seven series for the first time since 1996. As of 2024, this was the Bulls’ most recent playoff sweep. With the loss, the Heat became the first defending champion in 50 seasons to be swept in the first round. In addition, the Heat were swept in a postseason series for the first time since 2001.\nFor the second consecutive postseason, the Phoenix Suns defeated the Los Angeles Lakers. The Suns would not win another playoff series against the Lakers until 2021.\nWith their shocking first round upset over the Dallas Mavericks, The Golden State Warriors became the third eighth seed to beat a top seed and the first team to do so since the first round was extended to a best of seven in 2003. The Warriors were also the first team to eliminate a top seed since the 1999 New York Knicks’ Cinderella run to the Finals. With the loss, the Dallas Mavericks earned the dubious distinction of becoming the first (and currently only) .800 regular season team to lose in the first round. With the win, the Golden State Warriors also won their first playoff series since 1991.\nWith their first round series losses, the Miami Heat and Dallas Mavericks became the first NBA Finals pair to lose in the first round in the following year's playoffs. They also share the dubious distinction of being the second and third top seeds, respectively, to lose to an eighth seed in the first round in the NBA Playoffs.\nThe Jazz–Rockets series marked the eighth straight postseason in which at least one Game 7 was played. The Utah Jazz won over the Houston Rockets, giving the Jazz their first playoff series win since 2000 and the Rockets their fifth consecutive first round exit. This also marked the sole Game 7 of this season's playoffs.\n\nConference Semifinals\nWith the Heat and Mavericks eliminated in the first round, the Western Conference Semifinals series between the Phoenix Suns and San Antonio Spurs was considered “the real finals” as both teams had better records than the other remaining teams in the playoffs (thanks to the Suns’ 61–21 record and the Spurs’ 58–24 record, respectively).\nThe Detroit Pistons and Chicago Bulls met in the postseason for the first time since 1991, renewing the Bulls–Pistons rivalry.\nGame 4 of the Suns–Spurs series was extremely notable thanks to Robert Horry's flagrant foul on Steve Nash. During the incident, Horry also struck Raja Bell's shoulder, which resulted in a two-game suspension for Horry. In addition, Amar’e Stoudemire and Boris Diaw were suspended for one game for leaving the bench during the altercation.\nWith their Western Conference Semifinals victory over the Phoenix Suns, the San Antonio Spurs won their third consecutive playoff series against the Phoenix Suns.\nWith their Western Conference Semifinals win over the Golden State Warriors, the Utah Jazz made the conference finals for the first time since 1998 (when they last made the NBA Finals). As of 2024, however, this was the most recent time the Jazz advanced past the Conference Semifinals. The Warriors themselves would not advance past the Conference Semifinals until 2015.\nWith their Eastern Conference Semifinals win against the New Jersey Nets, the Cleveland Cavaliers made their first Conference Finals appearance since 1992. In addition, Game 6 of the Cavaliers–Nets series was the final NBA Playoff game ever played in New Jersey, as well as the last NBA Playoff game ever played at Continental Airlines Arena. The Nets would not return to the playoffs until 2013 as the Brooklyn Nets.\nWith their Eastern Conference Semifinals victory over the Chicago Bulls, the Detroit Pistons made their fifth consecutive Eastern Conference Finals appearance. The Bulls, on the other hand, would not make the Eastern Conference Finals until 2011.\n\nConference Finals\nDespite trailing 2–0 to the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals, the Cleveland Cavaliers won the series in six games to make their first ever NBA Finals appearance. Game 5 of the Pistons-Cavaliers series was extremely notable thanks to LeBron James scoring the Cavaliers’ final 25 points in a double-overtime thriller.\nWith their Western Conference Finals win over the Utah Jazz, the San Antonio Spurs made their fourth NBA Finals appearance, and their third of the 2000s decade.\n\nNBA Finals\nThe 2007 NBA Finals was significant due to it being the finals debut for LeBron James. He would not return to the Finals until 2011 (as a member of the Miami Heat). Due to LeBron's inexperience versus the seasoned San Antonio Spurs, this season's NBA Finals produced the lowest ratings of any NBA Finals until 2020.\nThe San Antonio Spurs won their fourth NBA Championship with a four-game sweep of the Cleveland Cavaliers, the first finals sweep since 2002. The Spurs also became the second team to win three titles in the 2000s decade (the other being the Los Angeles Lakers, who won three straight titles from 2000 to 2002).\nTony Parker is the first European Player to win NBA Finals MVP, and the second member of the San Antonio Spurs to do so, the other being Tim Duncan.\nAfter this series, the Spurs would not reach the NBA Finals until 2013 while the Cavaliers would not return until 2015.\n\nSeeding\nThe playoffs are conducted in 4 rounds of the best-of-7 series. The 3 division winners in each conference, along with the 5 best non-division winners, qualify for the playoffs. The division winners and top second-place team are seeded 1–4 based on record, with the remaining non-division winners are seeded 5–8 on record.\nUntil 2006, the division champions were guaranteed no worse than the third seed, while the non-division winners could do no better than the fourth seed regardless of record. This was the source of controversy in the 2006 NBA playoffs when the 63-win Spurs and 60-win Dallas Mavericks — the teams with the second-best and third-best records in the entire league—met in the conference semifinals. In response, the NBA changed the seeding system so that the teams with the two best records in the conference are guaranteed the top two seeds even if the second-best team isn't a division champion. Meanwhile, the division champions are guaranteed no worse than the fourth seed. This ensures that the teams with the two best records in the conference cannot meet until the conference finals at the earliest.\n\nPlayoff qualifying\nEastern Conference\nThe following teams clinched a playoff berth in the East:\n\nDetroit Pistons (53–29, clinched Central division, best regular season record in Eastern Conference, and home court advantage throughout the Eastern Conference playoffs)\nCleveland Cavaliers (50–32)\nToronto Raptors (47–35, clinched Atlantic division)\nMiami Heat (44–38, clinched Southeast division)\nChicago Bulls (49–33)\nNew Jersey Nets (41–41; 4–0 head-to-head vs. WSH)\nWashington Wizards (41–41, 0–4 head-to-head vs. NJ)\nOrlando Magic (40–42)\n\nWestern Conference\nThe following teams clinched a playoff berth in the West:\n\nDallas Mavericks (67–15, clinched Southwest division, best regular season record, and home court advantage throughout the playoffs)\nPhoenix Suns (61–21, clinched Pacific division)\nSan Antonio Spurs (58–24)\nUtah Jazz (51–31, clinched Northwest division)\nHouston Rockets (52–30)\nDenver Nuggets (45–37)\nLos Angeles Lakers (42–40, 4–0 head-to-head vs. Golden State)\nGolden State Warriors (42–40, 0–4 head-to-head vs. LA Lakers)\n\nBracket\nThis is the bracket for the 2007 NBA Playoffs. Teams in italics had home court advantage. Teams in bold advanced to the next round. Numbers to the left of each team indicate the team's original seeding in their respective conferences. Numbers to the right of each team indicate the number of games the team won in that round. The division champions possess an asterisk (*).\n\nNotes\nHouston and Chicago had home court advantage in the first round despite being lower seeds. Both teams had better regular season records than their opponents, but did not have the best record of the non-division-champion playoff teams in their respective conferences.\n\nFirst round\nEastern Conference first round\n(1) Detroit Pistons vs. (8) Orlando Magic\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with each team winning one series apiece.\n\nThe Orlando Magic's first playoff trip in 4 seasons was short lived as the top ranked Detroit Pistons dispatched the upstart Magic in 4 games. The Pistons recorded their first series sweep since sweeping Indiana in the first round of the 1990 NBA playoffs. The series was also the first time Orlando forward Grant Hill had appeared in the postseason since leaving Detroit after the 2000 season.\n\n(2) Cleveland Cavaliers vs. (7) Washington Wizards\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Cavaliers winning two of the first three meetings.\n\nA rematch of the previous year's first round series was spoiled when Wizards stars Gilbert Arenas and Caron Butler were both forced out of the playoffs due to injuries received in the later parts of the regular season. Without Arenas and Butler, the Wizards were unable to stop LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers from sweeping them out of the playoffs. It was Cleveland's first playoff sweep in franchise history.\n\n(3) Toronto Raptors vs. (6) New Jersey Nets\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Nets and the Raptors.\nThe Nets won the first round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs in their sixth straight appearance in the NBA Playoffs. The series was the only one in the Eastern Conference first round not to result in a sweep.\nThe series was notable for pitting ex-Raptor Vince Carter, who was traded to the Nets in 2004 after an acrimonious split, against his former team. So great was the Toronto crowd's disdain for Carter, that he was booed every time he touched the ball. The Nets took home court advantage in Game 1, holding off a late Raptors rally in the fourth quarter. The Raptors pulled away in Game 2 and tied the series at 1. When the series shifted to New Jersey, the Nets took charge of the series, winning Games 3 and 4 in routs. New Jersey had a chance to win the series in Game 5 in Toronto, but the Raptors took a 20-point lead after one quarter. Still, New Jersey managed to chip away, and had a chance to win it, but Boštjan Nachbar's 3 missed at the buzzer. Needing to win in New Jersey to force a Game 7, Toronto held a one-point lead with under a minute to play in Game 6, but Richard Jefferson hit a layup with 8 seconds left. Toronto attempted to try for the game-winning shot, but Jefferson intercepted the pass to seal the series for the Nets.\n\n(4) Miami Heat vs. (5) Chicago Bulls\nGame 4 is Gary Payton's final NBA game.\n\nThis was the fifth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Bulls winning three of the first four meetings.\n\nThe Bulls won their first playoff series since the 1998 NBA Finals and the retirement of Michael Jordan. This was the Bulls first 4-game sweep, since sweeping the Magic in the 1996 Eastern Conference Finals. Meanwhile, Miami became the first defending champion since 1957 to be swept in the First Round the following season.\nIn addition, Southeast Division champions Miami and other division qualifiers Washington and Orlando were swept (0–12) by Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit respectively, all from the Central Division (12–0).\n\nWestern Conference first round\n(1) Dallas Mavericks vs. (8) Golden State Warriors\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Mavericks and the Warriors.\nThe Warriors qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 1994, the second longest such streak in league history. However, the Warriors were heavy underdogs against the Dallas Mavericks despite sweeping the regular season series between the teams, as Dallas had one of the best records in NBA regular season history. Expectations of a short series were immediately dashed by Golden State's Game 1 victory in Dallas, behind guard Baron Davis and his rather frantic style of play. The Mavericks came back to win Game 2 to tie the series at 1.\nBut when the series shifted to Oakland for the next two games, a new X-factor emerged for the Warriors: their home crowd at the Oracle Arena. The electric crowd, which was the highest paid attendance crowd for an NBA game in the history of that arena, gave the Warriors a huge lift as they blew out Dallas in Game 3, and edged out a close victory in Game 4. As the series shifted back to Dallas, the top-ranked Mavericks found themselves one game from seeing their record breaking season end prematurely. The Mavericks gave their all and staved off elimination in Game 5, but had nothing left in Game 6 in Oakland. The Warriors used a third-quarter 18–0 run, sparked by Stephen Jackson's 13 straight points en route to a franchise playoff record seven 3-pointers, and an unexpected collapse from MVP candidate Dirk Nowitzki (2–13 from the field with 8 points) to finish Dallas and become the first #8 seed to win a best-of-7 series in the first round, and just the third overall in NBA history, following the Denver Nuggets in 1994 and the New York Knicks en route to the 1999 NBA Finals. The Warriors also won their first playoff series since 1991. The Mavericks also became the second team who had a 65+ winning record not to win a championship, the first being the 1972–73 Boston Celtics, and the most recently, the 2017-18 Houston Rockets. To date, they are the only ones who were eliminated in the first round.\nBoth 2006 NBA Finalists (Dallas and Miami) were eliminated in the first round despite being top 4 seeds. This was the first time since 1957 that this had happened. This would not happen again until 2021 when the NBA Finalists from the previous season (L.A. Lakers and Miami Heat) were eliminated in the first round as lower-seeded teams.\n\n(2) Phoenix Suns vs. (7) Los Angeles Lakers\nThis was the 11th playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning seven of the first ten meetings.\n\nKobe Bryant and the Lakers went up against the high powered Phoenix Suns in a rematch of the previous year's first round series, which saw the Lakers take a 3–1 lead before the Suns took the series in 7. Unlike the previous series, the Suns had near complete control of the series, taking the series in 5. The Suns advanced to their third straight conference semifinals by eliminating the Lakers in the first round for the second straight year. In Game 4, Phoenix point guard Steve Nash made a run at the record for most assists in a playoff game, finishing one shy of the record 24 shared by Magic Johnson and John Stockton.\n\n(3) San Antonio Spurs vs. (6) Denver Nuggets\nThis was the sixth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Spurs winning four of the first five meetings.\n\nThe Nuggets duo of Carmelo Anthony and Allen Iverson got Denver off to a fast start, winning Game 1 and taking home-court advantage away from Tim Duncan and the Spurs. Despite the early letdown, the Spurs showed their championship mettle and bounced back for a 97–88 win in Game 2. In the pivotal Game 3, the Nuggets built an eight-point first-quarter lead before Manu Ginóbili's eight second-quarter points put San Antonio up 43–40 at halftime. A back-and-forth contest turned in the final 2:24 of the third quarter: Michael Finley hit two 3-pointers, and Robert Horry later hit a 3 that gave the Spurs a 75–67 lead at the end of the quarter. They hung on for a 96–91 win.\nDenver started strong again in Game 4 and led by eight at halftime. But San Antonio stormed back after Anthony went to the bench in the third quarter with his fourth foul. The Spurs held a one-point lead with 30 seconds left when Horry, playing for his seventh championship ring, hit a 3 from the right corner to help seal a 96–89 win. The stunned Nuggets did not recover from the Game 4 letdown. Finley was the hero in Game 5, hitting a team-playoff-record eight threes for 26 points as San Antonio won 93–78 to end the series, marking the Nuggets' fourth straight season where they lost in the first round in five games. This is the second time in three seasons that the Nuggets lost the first-round series to the Spurs, after taking Game 1 in San Antonio (the first also happened in five games).\n\n(4) Utah Jazz vs. (5) Houston Rockets\nThis was the sixth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Jazz winning three of the first five meetings.\n\nThe resurgent Utah Jazz, fresh off one of their best seasons since the John Stockton/Karl Malone years, faced Yao Ming, Tracy McGrady and the Houston Rockets, who were seeking their first playoff series victory in 10 years. Home court advantage proved to be the key as the series progressed, as both the Rockets and the Jazz won closely contested matches in front of their home crowds.\nAs a result, the series had to go to a seventh and deciding game, which was played in Houston since the Rockets had the better record and thereby earned home court advantage, despite the division-winning Jazz being the higher-seeded team. Nevertheless, Utah overcame the Houston crowd and stunned the Rockets for the win on the road. The Jazz became only the third road team in history to win Game 7 of a seven-game series in which the home team won each of the first six games, after the Boston Celtics in the 1969 NBA Finals and the Baltimore Bullets in the 1971 Eastern Conference Finals. Houston's Tracy McGrady lost his sixth straight post-season series (out of 10 seasons) and has never played past the first round in his entire career.\nAfter losing the series, the Rockets failed to reach a new contract agreement with their head coach Jeff Van Gundy, who was subsequently fired.\n\nConference semifinals\nEastern Conference semifinals\n(1) Detroit Pistons vs. (5) Chicago Bulls\nThis was the sixth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Pistons winning three of the first five meetings.\n\nIn a renewal of a rivalry from the late '80s and early '90s, the Chicago Bulls and the Detroit Pistons faced off against each other. This was also the first time since 1995 that teams from the two cities met in a major league postseason or game. The series began fairly one-sided as the Pistons took Games 1 and 2 in Detroit in blowout fashion, followed by another convincing victory in Game 3 in Chicago. In all 3 games, the Bulls looked severely outmatched against the more experienced Pistons squad. Expectations were low for the Bulls, since no NBA team has ever won a seven-game series after being down 3–0. (It has only happened five times total in sports history, the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs, 1975 New York Islanders, 2004 Boston Red Sox, 2010 Philadelphia Flyers and 2014 Los Angeles Kings.)\nDespite the huge obstacle, the Bulls rallied to take Game 4 in a romp, and then proceeded to shock everyone with a blow-out victory in Detroit in Game 5. Despite the renewed momentum, the Pistons' playoff experience ultimately won out as they closed out the Bulls in a 95-85 Game 6 win. The Pistons advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals for the fifth straight year.\n\n(2) Cleveland Cavaliers vs. (6) New Jersey Nets\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Cavaliers winning the first two meetings.\n\nThe Cavaliers advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 1992, while the Nets lost in the Conference Semifinals in three out of the last four years. Game 6 was the final playoff game at the Continental Airlines Arena, while also the last NBA playoff game ever played in New Jersey (the Prudential Center never hosted an NBA playoff game during the Nets' tenure from 2010 to 2012).\nNew Jersey Nets point guard Jason Kidd averaged a triple double the entire playoffs, scoring 14.6 points, grabbing 10.9 rebounds and dishing out 10.9 assists per game.\n\nWestern Conference semifinals\n(2) Phoenix Suns vs. (3) San Antonio Spurs\nThis was the eighth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Spurs winning four of the first seven meetings.\n\nThe highly anticipated match-up between the high-powered Phoenix Suns, led by 2-time MVP Steve Nash, and the fundamentally sound San Antonio Spurs, led by 3-time Finals MVP Tim Duncan, had high expectations before the series tip-off. The Suns were looking to make the conference finals for the third straight year, and also looking for their first Finals berth since 1993. The Spurs on the other hand, were looking for their third trip in five years, and their fourth NBA title overall. The series received international interest with a playoff-record of 12 players originating outside the US. When the series ended, it had become one of the most hotly contested and controversial series in recent NBA history.\nThe Suns had their home court advantage quickly taken away as the Spurs took a tight Game 1, a game that saw Nash missing the final minutes for Phoenix due to a gash to his nose, which bled profusely. Nash and the Suns recovered to take Game 2 but after the game, Suns forward Amar'e Stoudemire accused the Spurs, especially Bruce Bowen and Manu Ginóbili, of being a dirty team. Despite the added scrutiny by the media circles, the Spurs won Game 3. The Suns, trying to overcome their recent failures against Texas teams in the playoffs (the Spurs and the Mavericks both defeated them in the Conference Finals), willed themselves to a come-from-behind victory in Game 4 to tie the series at 2.\nHowever, the celebration was short-lived. In the closing minute of Game 4, with the Suns up 3, Nash brought up the ball and was shoved into the press table by Robert Horry, creating a momentary ruckus, wherein Raja Bell received a technical. As this took place, Stoudemire and Boris Diaw left the Suns bench. Although they were not involved in the altercation, they broke an established NBA rule that prohibits players from leaving the bench during an altercation. As a result, the NBA suspended Stoudemire and Diaw for one game, while Horry received a two-game suspension for the flagrant foul and ejection. Severely undermanned, the Suns came into Game 5 with the task of beating the Spurs without their star big man.\nAlthough the Suns were able to control most of the game without the suspended players, even taking a 16-point lead on the Spurs at one point, the Spurs came back to win an incredibly close Game 5. Diaw and Stoudemire did return for the Suns in Game 6, though that didn't help the Suns to force a Game 7 and the Spurs eliminated them to advance to the Western Conference Finals with a 114–106 win.\n\n(4) Utah Jazz vs. (8) Golden State Warriors\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Warriors winning the first two meetings.\n\nFresh off their stunning upset of the top-seeded Dallas Mavericks, the Golden State Warriors faced a very different team in Utah. The Warriors continued the frantic style of play they exhibited against the Mavericks, but the Jazz, a more defensive-minded team, managed to shut them down to take Game 1. The Warriors tried to bounce back in Game 2, and took the Jazz to overtime. But the Jazz were able to prevail, due to the inspired clutch play of guard Derek Fisher, who arrived at halftime after being with his family in New York City because of his daughter's emergency eye cancer surgery.\nThe series shifted back to Oakland and the raucous Oracle Arena crowd, which lifted the Warriors to a resounding blowout in Game 3, a game which saw the Warriors hit a playoff record 11 threes in the first half. However, the Jazz shrugged off the crowd and handed the Warriors their only playoff home loss of the year in Game 4. The Warriors' playoff run ended as the Jazz finished them off in Game 5. The Jazz advanced to the Western Conference Finals for the first time since 1998.\n\nConference finals\nEastern Conference finals\n(1) Detroit Pistons vs. (2) Cleveland Cavaliers\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Pistons winning the first meeting.\n\nIn a rematch of the thrilling 2006 second-round series, the Pistons and Cavaliers matched up in perhaps one of the most closely contested series in NBA history, with the first five games being decided by six points or less. The spotlight fell on LeBron James. Despite gaining some momentum in the opening games of the series against the experienced Pistons, key last-second decisions by James led to Cleveland losses in Games 1 and 2 in Detroit, by identical scores, in which Cleveland led for most of the two games. They faced a 0–2 deficit for the second straight year, but would easily remember from the year before that they could win three straight games to get back into the series.\nWith media circles on his back for his complacency in these games (James had a then playoff career low 10 points in Game 1), James came back to will the Cavs to close victories in Games 3 and 4 in Cleveland, evening the series at 2. The series shifted back to Detroit for a Game 5 that proved to be one of the most memorable postseason games in recent NBA history. In a match that went into double overtime, the Cavaliers stunned the Pistons on their home court, thanks to LeBron James' playoff career-high 48-point performance. James scored the Cavaliers' final 25 points, including all 18 points in overtime, forced the second OT with a driving dunk and made a driving layup with 2.2 seconds left in the second OT to silence the Palace crowd. A game tying buzzer beater by Chauncey Billups rimmed out making it two straight 2-point wins at the Palace in Game 5.\nThe Cavaliers took advantage of their home court in 2007 and exploded in Game 6 to close out the Pistons, and to clinch the franchise's first trip to the NBA Finals (in the process denying a rematch of the 2005 NBA Finals between the Pistons and Spurs). Rookie Daniel Gibson scored a career-high 31 points, including five 3-pointers, to lift the Cavs in the second half behind a roaring home crowd.\n\nWestern Conference finals\n(3) San Antonio Spurs vs. (4) Utah Jazz\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Jazz winning the first three meetings.\n\nFor the first time since 1990, neither the #1 nor #2 seed participated in the Western Conference Finals. However, the series pitted youth against experience as the up-and-coming Utah Jazz faced off against the seasoned San Antonio Spurs. Coming into the series, the Jazz were not given much of a chance due to their inexperience. However, Carlos Boozer, Deron Williams and the Jazz were able to hold their own against San Antonio for a good part of the series.\nUnfortunately, it was not enough. The series' first 2 games – both San Antonio home victories – saw the Spurs blow big first-half leads and the Jazz mount last-gasp rallies that were thwarted by San Antonio's clutch shooting. When the Spurs' 19-point first-half lead dwindled to 95-87 late in the fourth quarter of Game 1, Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginóbili came through with timely shots down the stretch. When San Antonio's 22-point edge shrank to 83-76 late in Game 2, Bruce Bowen broke Utah's rhythm with a 3 from the left corner and another from the right to end the threat.\nThe Jazz, who were undefeated at home in the postseason coming into the series, had their most cohesive effort in a 109-83 Game 3 rout. Utah pestered Duncan into early foul trouble and got baskets from players other than Williams and Boozer, who had combined for 57.7% of their team's points through the first two games. But Jazz fans' euphoria over the team's only series victory gave way to frustration in Game 4 – with most of it aimed at Ginóbili and his flopping. 11 of his 16 fourth-quarter points came at the foul line in an ugly overall team performance in which the Spurs made more free throws (30) than field goals (28). Contributing to that discrepancy were four technical fouls called against Utah in the fourth. The subsequent ejections of Utah head coach Jerry Sloan and Jazz guard Derek Fisher had a charged-up EnergySolutions Arena crowd raining debris onto the court in protest.\nThe unflappable Spurs responded with yet another commanding start in Game 5. They outscored the Jazz by 19 in the first quarter and led by as many as 29. Not even another late-game arrival of Fisher (from New York again) could help the Jazz enough and the Spurs won a 109–84 series-clinching victory and an eventual date in the NBA Finals with the Cavaliers.\n\nNBA Finals: (W3) San Antonio Spurs vs. (E2) Cleveland Cavaliers\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Cavaliers and the Spurs.\nThe Cavaliers, led by superstar LeBron James, entered the 2007 Finals looking for their first franchise championship, as well as the first championship for a pro team based out of Cleveland since the Cleveland Browns won the 1964 National Football League Championship. However, the Cavs were considered heavy underdogs against the 3-time champion Spurs. The Spurs' veteran leadership and championship experience overwhelmed the Cavs, who were swept by the Spurs after two blowouts in San Antonio and two close games in Cleveland.\n\nStatistic leaders\nBroadcasters\nEastern Conference first round\nNational television\nLocal television\nLocal radio\nWestern Conference first round\nEastern Conference semifinals\nNational television\nLocal television\nNational radio\nLocal radio\nEastern Conference finals\nWestern Conference finals\nNBA Finals\nSee also\nNBA records\n\nNotes\nExternal links\nOfficial website of the 2007 NBA Playoffs\nESPN's NBA page",
    "2008 NBA playoffs": "The 2008 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 2007–08 season. The tournament concluded with the Eastern Conference champion Boston Celtics defeating the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers 4 games to 2 in the NBA Finals. Paul Pierce was named NBA Finals MVP.\n\nOverview\nThanks to preseason trades for Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen, the Boston Celtics entered the playoffs with an NBA best 66–16 record. It was also their first playoff appearance since 2005.\nThe Los Angeles Lakers entered their third consecutive postseason. Thanks to a midseason trade for Pau Gasol, they entered the playoffs as the top seed in the west for the first time since 2000.\nThe Phoenix Suns entered their fourth consecutive postseason. However, they lost to the defending champion San Antonio Spurs in the first round.\nThe Atlanta Hawks made the playoffs for the first time since 1999, taking the top seed and eventual champion Boston Celtics to seven games before bowing out.\nThe New Orleans Hornets made the playoffs for the first time since 2004 and for the first time as a member of the Western Conference. This was notable since this marks the playoff debut of Chris Paul and the Hornets’ first postseason appearance after Hurricane Katrina, pushing the defending champions San Antonio Spurs to seven games in the Conference Semifinals before bowing out. The Hornets would not win another playoff series until 2018, in which they were now known today as the Pelicans. To date, 2008 was the closest the New Orleans franchise had ever come from reaching the Conference Finals; as of 2024 the Pelicans and the Charlotte Hornets are the only active teams to never advance to the Conference Finals.\nThe Golden State Warriors won 48 games, more than 5 of the 8 playoff teams in the Eastern Conference. However, all eight qualifiers in the Western Conference finished with at least 50 wins, thus leaving the Warriors out of the postseason.\nThe New Jersey Nets missed the playoffs for the first time since 2001, largely due to a trade that sent Jason Kidd to the Dallas Mavericks. The Miami Heat missed the playoffs for the first time since 2003, thanks to a league worst 15–67 record. It also marked the first NBA postseason since 2003 not to feature Dwyane Wade. The Chicago Bulls also missed the playoffs for the first time since 2004.\nWith their first round series victory over the Toronto Raptors, the Orlando Magic won their first playoff series since 1996. However, they lost to the Detroit Pistons in the Conference Semifinals.\nWith their first round sweep of the Denver Nuggets, the Los Angeles Lakers won their first playoff series since 2004 (when they last made the NBA Finals). It also marked the only sweep of the 2008 playoffs.\nWith their conference semifinals win over the Orlando Magic, the Detroit Pistons entered their sixth consecutive conference finals. The Pistons also became the first team since the Showtime Lakers to accomplish this feat. As of 2024, this remains The Pistons’ most recent series win.\nGame 7 of the conference semifinals between the Boston Celtics and Cleveland Cavaliers became notable for a duel between Paul Pierce and LeBron James, who scored 41 and 45 points, respectively. The Celtics won this game and advanced to the conference finals.\nWith their conference finals win over the defending champion San Antonio Spurs, the Los Angeles Lakers returned to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2004. They also became the first top seed since 2003 to make the NBA Finals.\nWith their conference finals win over the Detroit Pistons, the Boston Celtics made the NBA Finals for the first time since 1987. As of 2024, Game 4 of the Conference Finals was The Pistons’ most recent playoff win.\nFor the first time since 2000, the top seeds from each Conference met in the NBA Finals. The 2008 Finals was also the first since 1998 to feature neither Shaquille O'Neal nor Tim Duncan.\nThe Boston Celtics played 26 playoff games (2 games short of a full length postseason of 28), breaking the 25 game record of the 1994 Knicks and 2005 Pistons by 1 game for the most playoff games in a single season played by 1 NBA team. The Knicks, however, only played a Best–of–5 First Round, and so had 2 fewer games to accomplish that feat.\n\nPlayoff qualifying\nEastern Conference\nThe following teams clinched a playoff berth in the East:\n\nBoston Celtics (66–16, clinched Atlantic Division, and home court advantage throughout the playoffs)\nDetroit Pistons (59–23, clinched Central Division title)\nOrlando Magic (52–30, clinched Southeast Division title)\nCleveland Cavaliers (45–37)\nWashington Wizards (43–39)\nToronto Raptors (41–41)\nPhiladelphia 76ers (40–42)\nAtlanta Hawks (37–45)\n\nWestern Conference\nThe following teams clinched a playoff berth in the West:\n\nLos Angeles Lakers (57–25, clinched Pacific Division title, and home-court advantage throughout the Western Conference playoffs)\nNew Orleans Hornets (56–26, clinched Southwest Division title, 34–18 record vs. Western Conference)\nSan Antonio Spurs (56–26, 33–19 record vs. Western Conference)\nUtah Jazz (54–28, clinched Northwest Division title)\nHouston Rockets (55–27, 2–2 head-to-head vs. PHO, 33–19 record vs. Western Conference)\nPhoenix Suns (55–27, 2–2 head-to-head vs. HOU, 31–21 record vs. Western Conference)\nDallas Mavericks (51–31)\nDenver Nuggets (50–32)\n\nBracket\nThis was the outlook for the 2008 NBA Playoffs.

Numbers to the right of each team indicate the number of games the team won in that round. The division champions possess an asterisk (*).\n\nFirst round\nEastern Conference first round\n(1) Boston Celtics vs. (8) Atlanta Hawks\nThis was the tenth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Celtics winning eight of the first nine meetings.\n\nGames 1 and 2 were Celtic routs, keyed by great team defense (Atlanta averaged 79 points in the first 2 games) and balanced Celtic scoring (six players were in double figures in Game 1, five in Game 2). The most buzz was generated by Mike Bibby stating that Celtic fans were bandwagoners after Game 1, prompting boos every time he touched the ball in Game 2.\nIn Game 3, Atlanta showed its athleticism with an array of dunks from Josh Smith (26 points) and a strong interior performance by the rookie Al Horford (17 points, 14 rebounds, 6 assists), who also jawed with Paul Pierce near the end of the game. There would be more jawing in Game 4 between Zaza Pachulia and Kevin Garnett, but the outcome was a surprise: thanks to fourth quarter heroics by Joe Johnson and Smith, who combined to score 32 of Atlanta's 34 4th quarter points, the upstart Hawks rallied from a 10-point third quarter deficit in Game 4 to tie the series going back to Boston. Boston dominated Game 5, but in Game 6, six Hawks players finished in double figures to force a winner-take-all Game 7. The Hawks were no match for the Celtics in Game 7, as the Celtics held them to 26 points in the 1st half. 3 minutes into the 2nd half, the series' tensions finally boiled over when Marvin Williams was ejected for committing a hard foul on Rajon Rondo. Then after that, Kevin Garnett was noted for trucking Zaza Pachulia while going for a screen.\n\n(2) Detroit Pistons vs. (7) Philadelphia 76ers\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Pistons winning two of the first three meetings. The first meeting took place while the Nationals/76ers franchise were in Syracuse and the Pistons franchise were in Fort Wayne.\n\nMisses down the stretch by Tayshaun Prince and Rasheed Wallace kept the Pistons from beating the Sixers at their home floor as Andre Iguodala grabbed clutch defensive rebounds to seize home court advantage. The Pistons responded with a blowout in Game 2. Game 3 was close at halftime, but Samuel Dalembert and Andre Miller helped to break it open with strong overall performances. Detroit was behind by 10 in Game 4 at halftime and in danger of falling behind 3–1 going back home, but three second-half 3s by Rasheed Wallace and strong showings by Tayshaun Prince and Chauncey Billups keyed an 18-point 3rd quarter turnaround which evened the series. Detroit dominated Game 5 behind Billups's 14 points and 5 first quarter assists, jumping out to a 14-point lead and never looking back. Richard Hamilton keyed a similar start in Game 6, scoring 13 points, as the Pistons took an 18-point first quarter lead and eventually rolled into the second round.\n\n(3) Orlando Magic vs. (6) Toronto Raptors\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Magic and the Raptors.\nScoring 25 points and grabbing 22 rebounds, Dwight Howard gave the Magic their first playoffs win since 2003 as they practically led the entire game. Howard put up 29 and 20 in Game 2, as Hedo Türkoğlu scored the final four go-ahead points to give the Magic a 2–0 lead. The Raptors would respond with a strong Game 3 victory keyed by great point guard play from T. J. Ford and José Calderón. But Jameer Nelson, Rashard Lewis and Keith Bogans keyed strong three point shooting in Game 4 and overcame Chris Bosh's 39 points and 15 rebounds to bring the Magic out of Toronto with a 3–1 lead. Howard finished off the series in Game 5 as impressively as he started–21 points, 21 rebounds, 3 blocks giving the Magic their first playoff series victory since 1996.\n\n(4) Cleveland Cavaliers vs. (5) Washington Wizards\nThis was the fifth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Cavaliers winning three of the first four meetings.\n\nLeBron James, labeled as \"overrated\" by Wizards guard DeShawn Stevenson, scored 20 of his 32 points in the second half to help the Cavs draw first blood in their third first round meeting in as many years. The Cavs and Wizards traded blowouts in Games 2 and 3, but Cleveland took a 3–1 lead in the Verizon Center off of Delonte West's last second 3. Washington stayed alive by winning Game 5 when Caron Butler converted a running shot with only seconds left, capping off his 32-point performance. However, James led the Cavs to a dominating Game 6 victory in Washington with a triple-double (27 points, 13 rebounds, 13 assists); he also received crucial outside shooting from Wally Szczerbiak and Daniel Gibson, who combined for 48 points.\nThis series was marked by several physical plays on James, with Brendan Haywood, Stevenson, and Darius Songaila picking up technical and flagrant fouls for hard contact on him.\n\nWestern Conference first round\n(1) Los Angeles Lakers vs. (8) Denver Nuggets\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning the first three meetings.\n\nIn Pau Gasol's playoff debut with the Lakers, he scored 36 points, 16 rebounds, 8 assists and 3 blocks as the Lakers beat the Nuggets in Game 1. Kobe Bryant gave the fans a vintage performance in Game 2 by scoring 49 points and adding 10 assists in a blowout at Staples Center. The Nuggets were routed at home in Game 3, with Carmelo Anthony stating the team quit in the second half. Game 4 was closer, but Bryant led the Lakers with 14 points in the last 5½ minutes to sweep the Nuggets at the Pepsi Center. It was the first time the Lakers advanced to the second round since the 2004 season. The Lakers led at the end of every quarter throughout the whole series, only the seventh time that had happened in NBA history.\n\n(2) New Orleans Hornets vs. (7) Dallas Mavericks\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Mavericks and the New Orleans Pelicans/Hornets franchise.\nIn his playoff debut, Chris Paul scored 35 points, dished out 10 assists, and stole the ball 4 times to lead the Hornets to a comeback home win against the Mavericks. He would replicate that type of performance in Game 2 with 32 points and 17 assists. Dallas would come out with a dominant Game 3 performance at home after inserting Jason Terry into the starting lineup, but New Orleans would win the final 2 games of the series, keyed by David West in Game 4 and Paul's triple-double in Game 5.\n\n(3) San Antonio Spurs vs. (6) Phoenix Suns\nThis was the ninth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Spurs winning five of the first eight meetings.\n\nMichael Finley made a game-tying three in regulation, Tim Duncan scored 40 points, including a rare three-point field goal to force a second overtime, and Manu Ginóbili clinched victory with a drive to the basket to break the 115-all deadlock with 1.8 seconds left to win a classic Game 1. Tony Parker would then pace the Spurs to their next two victories in the series, scoring 32 and 41 in Games 2 and 3 respectively. At the brink of elimination, Phoenix responded with a strong Game 4. But costly missed free throws by Shaquille O'Neal and key turnovers by Steve Nash helped San Antonio to prevail in Game 5, led again by Parker's 31 points.\nAlso notable was Gregg Popovich's use of the Hack-a-Shaq throughout the series to disrupt the Suns offense when Shaquille O'Neal was on the floor. O'Neal would shoot 64 free throws in the five games, making 32 of them.\n\n(4) Utah Jazz vs. (5) Houston Rockets\nThis was the seventh playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Jazz winning four of the first six meetings.\n\nThe Jazz had a balanced game from Andrei Kirilenko, Carlos Boozer and Deron Williams to steal the home court advantage away from the Rockets. A similar performance in Game 2 put Utah in a commanding 2–0 lead going back to Salt Lake City. Rafer Alston's return to the Houston lineup after injury, along with Tracy McGrady's 27 points and Carl Landry's key block of Deron Williams helped Houston steal Game 3 on the road. Williams responded with a strong performance in a Game 4 victory, plus got some help from Mehmet Okur with his offensive rebound off of his two missed free throws. The Rockets controlled Game 5 to stay alive, but despite getting 40 points, 10 rebounds, and 5 assists from McGrady in Game 6 and 15 pts from Luis Scola, the rest of the team shot 10/39 from the field and could not overcome losing Alston to an ankle injury as the Jazz blew the game open with a 27–11 3rd quarter.\n\nConference semifinals\nEastern Conference semifinals\n(1) Boston Celtics vs. (4) Cleveland Cavaliers\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Celtics winning two of the first three meetings.\n\nAlthough the Celtics had a quick turnaround from their unexpected seven-game series with Atlanta, they managed to hold off the Cavs by winning the first two games in Boston. Kevin Garnett scored 28 points and 8 rebounds and made the go-ahead shot in Game 1. LeBron James would only shoot 8 for 42 from the field in the first 2 games.\nCleveland would come back to win the next two games, Game 3, a blowout where five Cavs scored in double figures, and Game 4 where James would punctuate the victory with a dunk over Garnett. James's shooting improved in the return to the Garden in Game 5, but received minimal help from his teammates as Rajon Rondo, Garnett, and Paul Pierce all scored over 20 points to push Boston over the top. Game 6 was an ugly affair, with both teams shooting under 40 percent, but a 32–12–6 performance by James was enough. Boston, the best road team in the regular season, fell to 0–6 on the road.\nGame 7 would end in a duel between Pierce (41 points) and James (45 points) that some compared to the Bird–Wilkins duel in the 1988 Eastern Conference Semifinals. But timely offensive rebounding (10 in all), 18 second chance points, and a few key shots from Celtics veteran P.J. Brown helped push Boston into the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\n(2) Detroit Pistons vs. (3) Orlando Magic\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Pistons winning two of the first three meetings.\n\nThe Pistons opened up with a rout in Game 1, as Detroit's big men keyed in on Dwight Howard and forced him to playoff lows 12 points and 8 rebounds, with five Pistons scoring in double figures. After being quiet in Game 1, the Magic's 3-point shooting picked up (11/26, with Jameer Nelson making 5-of-8), but could not overcome 19 turnovers and fell down in the series 2–0. There was a controversial call at the end of the third quarter, where Chauncey Billups made a 3 near the end of the 3rd quarter when the clock froze and approximately 0.5 seconds remained, but TNT clocks later revealed that Billups could not have gotten the ball off in time.\nThe Magic would take a 24–6 lead at home in Game 3 and use a 38–17 4th quarter to blow out Detroit; they were paced by 33 points by Rashard Lewis. Billups would injure his right hamstring early in the game and miss the remainder of the series, but they would not need him for Game 4 as Richard Hamilton scored 32 points and the Pistons came from 15 back in the 3rd quarter. Tayshaun Prince made the go-ahead basket with 8.9 seconds left and Hedo Türkoğlu missed a layup as time ran out.\nBillups's starting replacement, Rodney Stuckey, struggled in Game 4, but came back with a strong Game 5. The Magic would outshoot the Pistons 48 to 36 percent, would make 36 percent of their 3s compared to 21 percent for Detroit, and outrebound them 46 to 38, but turned the ball over 21 times while Detroit had only 3. Rip Hamilton again led Detroit with 31 points, and Prince made the crucial defensive play by blocking Türkoğlu's layup in the waning seconds. Detroit advanced to their sixth straight Eastern Conference Finals, the longest Conference Finals streak since the Los Angeles Lakers went to eight straight in the 80s. As of 2024, this was most recent postseason series win by the Pistons.\n\nWestern Conference semifinals\n(1) Los Angeles Lakers vs. (4) Utah Jazz\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Jazz winning two of the first three meetings.\n\nThe Lakers took Game 1 in Staples Center, winning by 11 against the Jazz. After being presented with the season's NBA MVP award in Game 2, Kobe Bryant led the Lakers to victory with 34 points, 8 rebounds, and 6 assists. However, as the series shifted back to Utah, the Jazz responded, winning Games 3 and 4 behind the performances of Deron Williams and Carlos Boozer, who bounced back after two poor games in Los Angeles. The Lakers came back with authority as they took Game 5 with Bryant, Pau Gasol, and Lamar Odom scoring 20 plus points each. The Jazz looked to force a Game 7, but the Lakers did not trail and closed out the series in Game 6 with a 108–105 win at Utah, where the Jazz were 37–4 during the regular season. Bryant led the team with 34 points as the Lakers advanced to the Western Conference Finals, which they had not reached since 2004. This was the first playoff meeting between the two teams since the 1998 Western Conference Finals.\n\n(2) New Orleans Hornets vs. (3) San Antonio Spurs\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Spurs and the New Orleans Pelicans/Hornets franchise.\nThe Hornets, who earned the home-court advantage via winning the Southwest division, were able to gain a quick 2–0 lead over the veteran Spurs. But when the series shifted to San Antonio, the Spurs regained their edge, returning the favor in Games 3 and 4. Game 5 back in New Orleans shocked many as the Hornets played off the home crowd to a 22-point rout. The home teams were clearly dominating in this series as Game 6 was more of the same in San Antonio. However, that all changed when a much anticipated Game 7 saw the Spurs build a 15-point lead after 3 quarters, which proved to be enough (even after the Hornets cut the deficit to 3 with 1:35 left) to send them to another Western Conference Finals. The Spurs were the 4th team to win game 7 on the road after the home team won the first six.\n\nConference finals\nEastern Conference finals\n(1) Boston Celtics vs. (2) Detroit Pistons\nThis was the eighth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Celtics winning four of the first seven meetings.\n\nDetroit walked into the NBA Eastern Conference Finals for the sixth straight season. Boston held off the Pistons in Game 1 88–79, but let Detroit rally a strong performance in Game 2 to win it 103–97 (marking Boston's first home court loss in the post-season). However, they let the Celtics win their first road playoff game 94–80 in Game 3. Game 4 saw the Pistons win 94–75, however they lost Game 5 106–102 despite a scoring run late in the game. In Game 6, the Pistons strolled into the fourth quarter leading 70–60, but a lack of focus, a poor game from Rasheed Wallace, and a rally-destroying turnover by Tayshaun Prince ultimately led to their demise, as the Pistons would end their season losing 89–81. With that, the Celtics moved on to the NBA Finals, and they would face the Los Angeles Lakers for the 11th time. \nAs of 2024 Detroit hasn't won a playoff game since game 4 of this series.\n\nWestern Conference finals\n(1) Los Angeles Lakers vs. (3) San Antonio Spurs\nThis was the 11th playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning seven of the first ten meetings.\n\nThe series pitted the two best teams in the Western Conference over the last 10 years. Having home court advantage, the Lakers started out as a favorite and did not disappoint their home crowd as they overcame a 20-point deficit in Game 1 and won behind Kobe Bryant's 27 points, 25 of which were scored in the second half. Game 2 was a cruise for the Lakers as they made a 9–0 run before halftime, led all game and built the lead to 30.\nThe Spurs easily took Game 3 at home with Manu Ginóbili carrying the Spurs after two terrible games at L.A, making 5 3-pointers and finishing with 30 points; Tony Parker and Tim Duncan added 42 more. In Game 4 the Lakers never trailed (the Spurs missed several opportunities to take the lead) and led comfortably late, but a furious run by the Spurs and several mistakes by the Lakers (Bryant attempting a running fallaway with plenty of time on the shot clock, Gasol missing 2 free throws) gave San Antonio a chance to tie or win with seconds left. On a disputed no-call, Derek Fisher jumped up and collided with Brent Barry, but no foul was called and Barry missed a last second 3. The NBA later ruled that a foul should have been called on Fisher when he collided with Barry.\nHeading home up 3–1 in the series, the Lakers trailed in the first quarter by 17, but were able to cut the lead to six by halftime. Again, Bryant stepped up by scoring 17 of his 39 points in the fourth quarter, enabling the Lakers to surge ahead and seal the series, helping them to reach the NBA Finals for the 5th time in 9 seasons and the first time in the post-Shaq era.\nThe Lakers were able to reach the NBA Finals again as the #1 seed. The last time this happened to the team was during the 1999–2000 season, where they beat the Indiana Pacers 4–2. They also improved to 4–0 against San Antonio in the Western Conference Finals.\n\nNBA Finals: (W1) Los Angeles Lakers vs. (E1) Boston Celtics\nThis was the 11th playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Celtics winning eight of the first ten meetings. Two teams in the same cities, Boston and Los Angeles met in the 2008 ALDS when the Boston Red Sox defeated the Los Angeles Angels in four games.\n\nStatistic leaders\nBroadcast notes\nThe Playoffs began on Saturday April 19, with the Washington Wizards facing the Cleveland Cavaliers on ESPN.

    "2009 NBA playoffs": "The 2009 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 2008–09 season. The tournament concluded with the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers defeating the Eastern Conference champion Orlando Magic 4 games to 1 in the NBA Finals. Kobe Bryant was named NBA Finals MVP.\n\nOverview\nThe Portland Trail Blazers made the playoffs for the first time since 2003 and earned home court advantage in a playoff series for the first time since 2000.\nThe Miami Heat and the Chicago Bulls returned to the playoffs after a one-year absence. They pushed their first round opponents, the Atlanta Hawks and Boston Celtics (respectively) to seven games before losing.\nThe first round series between the Boston Celtics and Chicago Bulls set an NBA Playoff record for the most overtime games (4) and periods (7) played. However, the Boston Celtics prevailed in seven games.\nWith their first round win over the Portland Trail Blazers, the Houston Rockets won a first round series for the first time since 1997, when they last made the conference finals. They pushed the eventual champion Lakers to seven games before losing. The Rockets would not return to the playoffs until 2013.\nWith their first round win over the Miami Heat, the Atlanta Hawks won a playoff series for the first time since 1999. However, they were swept by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the conference semifinals.\nWith their first round win over the New Orleans Hornets, the Denver Nuggets won a playoff series for the first time since 1994, when they became the first eighth seed to win a playoff series.\nAs for the Detroit Pistons and San Antonio Spurs, they failed to advance past the first round for the first time since 2000. The Pistons were swept by the Cleveland Cavaliers, while the Spurs lost to the Dallas Mavericks in a five-game upset. The Pistons would not return to the playoffs until 2016, while the Spurs would exact revenge against the Mavericks in next year's playoffs.\nBy sweeping the Atlanta Hawks in the Conference Semifinals, the Cleveland Cavaliers became only the second team in NBA History (after the Miami Heat) to go 8–0 through the first two rounds by sweeping the Detroit Pistons and Atlanta Hawks (they would duplicate this feat in 2016, against the same two teams). This was also LeBron James’ last conference finals appearance as a member of the Cleveland Cavaliers until 2015.\nWith their conference semifinals victory over the Dallas Mavericks, the Denver Nuggets made the conference finals for the first time since 1985. However, they lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in six games, and would not return to the conference finals until 2020.\nWith their Game 7 road win over the Boston Celtics, the Orlando Magic made the Conference Finals for the first time since 1996. It also marked the first time the Boston Celtics lost a playoff series despite leading 3–2.\nWith their conference finals victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Orlando Magic made the NBA Finals for the first time since 1995. The Cavaliers would not return to the Conference Finals until 2015.\nGame 3 of the NBA Finals marked the first ever finals win for the Orlando Magic. However, they lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in five games.\nGame 4 of the NBA Finals marked the first time since 1985 that two overtime games were played in the same NBA Finals series.\nWith the Lakers’ Game 5 win over the Orlando Magic, Phil Jackson overtook Red Auerbach with the most NBA Championships won by a head coach (10). It also marked the Lakers’ first NBA Finals series win since 2002.\nGame 5 of the NBA Finals was also the last NBA Finals game ever played at Amway Arena.\n\nFormat\nThe 3 division winners and 5 other teams with the most wins from each conference qualify for the playoffs. The seedings are based on each team's record; however, a division winner is guaranteed to be ranked at least 4th, regardless of record. All series are in a best-of-7 format with the Games 1–2, 5 and 7 on the home court of the team with the better record, regardless of their seed. For the NBA Finals, the team with the better record plays Games 1–2 and 6–7 at home.\n\nTiebreak procedures\nThe tiebreakers that determine seedings are:\n\nDivision leader wins tie from team not leading a division\nHead-to-head record\nDivision record (if the teams are in the same division)\nConference record\nRecord vs. playoff teams, own conference\nRecord vs. playoff teams, other conference\nPoint differential, all games\nIf there are more than 2 teams tied, the team that wins the tiebreaker gets the highest seed, while the other teams are \"re-broken\" from the first step until all ties are resolved. Since the three division winners are guaranteed a spot in the top 4, ties to determine the division winners must be broken before any other ties.\n\nPlayoff qualifying\nEastern Conference\nWestern Conference\nNotes\n— = not applicable\n\na  The regular season series was tied 2–2.\nb  Tie between division leaders was broken first.\n\nBracket\nFirst round\nAll times are in Eastern Daylight Time (UTC−4)\n\nEastern Conference first round\n(1) Cleveland Cavaliers vs. (8) Detroit Pistons\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with each team winning one series apiece.\n\nThe Cavaliers opened the series with a rout on Game 1, as LeBron James scored 38 points and the Cavaliers won by 18 points. In Game 2, the Cavaliers were leading by 27 points after the third quarter before the Pistons started a comeback in the fourth quarter. The Pistons managed to cut the Cavaliers' lead down to 7 points, but in the end the Cavaliers won the game by 12 points. Game 3 was a tight contest until an 18–2 run by the Cavaliers in the fourth quarter secured the victory for Cleveland. The Cavaliers swept the Pistons with a 21-point victory in Game 4, in which James scored 36 points while narrowly missing a triple-double for two straight games.\n\n(2) Boston Celtics vs. (7) Chicago Bulls\nThis series has been called the greatest first round series ever, and compared to the greatest series overall.  It featured four overtime games with seven overtime periods, the most ever in a playoff series. The series highlights included future NBA MVP Derrick Rose setting an NBA single game rookie scoring record.  This was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Celtics winning the first three meetings.\n\nIn Game 1, with the Bulls trailing by 1, rookie Derrick Rose hit 2 free throws with 9.6 seconds left. Celtics captain Paul Pierce had a chance to win the game with his own free throws from a Joakim Noah foul but missed the second, leading to overtime. In the overtime, with Rose fouling out, Tyrus Thomas scored six of the Bulls' eight points to put them up 105–103 with about 50 seconds left. Ray Allen, who had a poor shooting night, had a chance to tie the game and send it into a second overtime but he did not succeed. Even while the playoffs were continuing, many experts and analysts were calling it \"the greatest playoff series ever\".\nRose matched Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's playoff debut of 36 points to lead the Bulls into a Game 1 road victory. Rose also became the second player to have a 35-point, 10-assist game in their playoff debut in history, after Chris Paul did the feat in 2008; his 36 points was also the highest points scored by a Bull in a playoff game since Michael Jordan retired. The win also marked the Bulls' first postseason win against the Celtics in history.\nIn Game 2, Ben Gordon poured in 42 points, but lost the duel to Ray Allen. The Bulls were blown out in Game 3. At home in the end of regulation of Game 4, Gordon hit a big bank shot putting the Bulls up 95–93. The Bulls would go on to win in 2OT.\nGame 5:\nThe Bulls held a double digit lead, and Boston came back behind Paul Pierce. Gordon hit a tough shot over Stephon Marbury. Pierce tied with his own jumper, Brad Miller missed 2 free throws with 2 seconds remaining in overtime, and Boston won.\nGame 6:\nThe Bulls had to come back from being down 8 in the final 2 minutes of regulation, and did so behind John Salmons. Ray Allen scored 51 points, but the Bulls won in 3OT.\nGame 7:\nThe Celtics finished the Bulls off with a 10-point victory.\n\n(3) Orlando Magic vs. (6) Philadelphia 76ers\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the 76ers winning the first meeting.\n\nIn Game 1, the Magic had an 18-point lead in the fourth quarter and Andre Iguodala scored a jumper with 2.2 seconds remaining to give the Sixers a road win over Hedo Türkoğlu. The Sixers almost managed another comeback in Game 2. The Magic led by 18 points midway through the third quarter before another late run by the Sixers brought the lead down to 5 points before the Magic finally won the game. The Sixers won Game 3 courtesy of another late shot; Thaddeus Young scored a layup with 2 seconds left to secure the win, despite a career playoff-high 36-point performance by Dwight Howard. The Magic secured a road win in Game 4 with their own late shot; Türkoğlu scored his own game-winning three-pointer with 1.1 seconds left to even the series.\nIn Game 5, Dwight Howard had 24 points and a career playoff-high 24 rebounds, leading the Magic to a victory. Game 5 was marked with an elbowing incident by Howard on Samuel Dalembert, which led to a one-game suspension for Howard. Rookie Courtney Lee also went down injured after taking an inadvertent elbow on the head from Howard. Despite losing two starters, Howard and Lee, the Magic won game 6, beating the Sixers on the road by 25 points to win the series.\n\n(4) Atlanta Hawks vs. (5) Miami Heat\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Hawks winning the first meeting.\n\nThe Hawks opened the series with a 26-point win after leading by as much as 20 points at halftime. The Hawks also tied a franchise record for fewest points allowed in a playoff game. However, the Heat managed to rebound from the loss and won Game 2 on the road to tie the series. The Heat won Game 3 at home, almost in similar fashion as the Hawks' victory in Game 1. The Heat was already leading by 19 points at halftime and ended up winning by 29 points. In the next game, the Hawks bounced back and won a road game to even the series.\nGame 5 was marked by several hard fouls and technical fouls. Dwyane Wade was fouled and sent tumbling down by Solomon Jones before a skirmish between Wade, Jones, Jamaal Magloire and Josh Smith started. All four players were given technical fouls in the incident. Wade was later called for a flagrant foul after he fouled Maurice Evans during a layup attempt. The flagrant foul was later rescinded by the officials after they reviewed the play. The Hawks finally won the game, despite losing starting center Al Horford due to injury in the second quarter. The Heat evened the series at 3–3 after winning Game 6. Wade scored 41 points to lead the Heat to a 26-point rout over the Hawks. The Hawks finally won the series after winning Game 7 at home, with 13 points difference. All seven games of the series were decided by at least 10 points, with an average margin of 19 points.\n\nWestern Conference first round\n(1) Los Angeles Lakers vs. (8) Utah Jazz\nThis was the fifth playoff meeting between these two teams, with each team winning two series apiece.\n\n(2) Denver Nuggets vs. (7) New Orleans Hornets\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Nuggets and the New Orleans Pelicans/Hornets franchise.\nThe Nuggets routed the Hornets in Game 1, led by hometown player Chauncey Billups's 36 points in his playoff debut for the Nuggets. He sank a career playoff-high 8 three-pointers and added 8 assists in the game. He continued his form in Game 2, scoring 31 points as the Nuggets took a 2–0 lead in the series. The Hornets bounced back with a victory in Game 3. Game 3 was marked with plenty of fouls, with a total of 58 personal fouls in the game, resulting in four players fouling out of the game, David West and Tyson Chandler for the Hornets, and Kenyon Martin and Nenê for the Nuggets. The referees also called three flagrant fouls from James Posey, Chandler and Billups. Hornets' head coach Byron Scott was also called for a technical foul after arguing on Posey's flagrant foul.\nThe Nuggets then pulled a 58-point win in Game 4. The margin tied the most lopsided victory in playoff history set 53 years ago by the Minneapolis Lakers. The Hornets recorded a playoff-low in points and also a playoff-high 26 turnovers, which led to 41 Nuggets' points. The Nuggets then recorded their first series win since 1994 after a victory in Game 5. Carmelo Anthony scored his career playoff-high with 34 points as the Nuggets cruised to another double-digit win. The average margin of victory in the Nuggets's four wins was 30.75 points.\n\n(3) San Antonio Spurs vs. (6) Dallas Mavericks\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Spurs winning two of the first three meetings.\n\n(4) Portland Trail Blazers vs. (5) Houston Rockets\nGame 2 is Dikembe Mutombo's final NBA game.\n\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Rockets winning the first two meetings.\n\nConference semifinals\nEastern Conference semifinals\n(1) Cleveland Cavaliers vs. (4) Atlanta Hawks\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Hawks and the Cavaliers.\n\n(2) Boston Celtics vs. (3) Orlando Magic\nThis was the first time the Celtics lost a series when leading 3–2.\nGame 7 is Stephon Marbury's last NBA game.\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Magic winning the first meeting.\n\nWestern Conference semifinals\n(1) Los Angeles Lakers vs. (5) Houston Rockets\nThis was the eighth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning four of the first seven meetings.\n\n(2) Denver Nuggets vs. (6) Dallas Mavericks\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Mavericks winning the first meeting.\n\nConference finals\nEastern Conference finals\n(1) Cleveland Cavaliers vs. (3) Orlando Magic\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Cavaliers and the Magic.\nIn Game 1, LeBron James dominated with a 49-point performance, while Howard had 30. Early in the game, Howard made a thunderous jam that caused the shot clock to fall backwards. Although James had a potential game-winning three-point play, a furious rally and a game-winning three-pointer by Rashard Lewis allowed the Magic to escape with a victory in game 1. Much like Game 1, Game 2 had the Cavs with an 18-point lead by the second quarter, only for the Magic to rally back in the closing minutes. A jump shot by Hedo Türkoğlu gave the Magic a 2-point lead with 1 second left on the clock, but LeBron James hit a three-pointer to tie the series at the buzzer. In Game 3, the Magic dominated at home, leading to a 10-point victory behind Dwight Howard's 24 points. In Game 4, two clutch free throws by LeBron James sent the game into overtime. While James dominated with 44 (his third 40-point game of the playoffs), an off half-court shot allowed the Magic to escape again with a victory. Down 3–1, James' triple-double allowed his team to stave off elimination in Game 5. After a win in Game 6, the Magic received their second NBA Finals berth in franchise history.\n\nWestern Conference finals\n(1) Los Angeles Lakers vs. (2) Denver Nuggets\nThis was the fifth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning the first four meetings.\nBefore the playoff matchup had happened, professional wrestling promotion World Wrestling Entertainment had booked its television program Monday Night Raw on August 15, 2008, at the Pepsi Center by Vince McMahon for May 25, 2009 show. Because the Nuggets needed the arena for games 3, 4 and 6, the WWE had decided to relocate Raw (and later the Friday Night SmackDown/ECW tapings) to Staples Center, the site of games 1, 2, 5 and 7 and Denver was given a house show on August 7 instead. The debacle would be a subject of a main event that night in a 10-man tag team match when a babyface team of John Cena, Batista, Montel Vontavious Porter, Jerry Lawler and  Mr. Kennedy donning Lakers jerseys took on heels The Legacy (Randy Orton, Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase, Jr.) and ShoMiz (The Big Show and The Miz) in Nuggets jerseys. Team Lakers would emerge victorious afterwards.\n\nNBA Finals: (W1) Los Angeles Lakers vs. (E3) Orlando Magic\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Lakers and the Magic.\n\nStatistic leader board\nSee also\nNBA records\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website of the 2009 NBA Playoffs\nESPN's NBA page\n2009 NBA Playoffs at Basketball Reference",
    "2010 NBA playoffs": "The 2010 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 2009-10 season. The tournament concluded with the Western Conference champion Los Angeles Lakers defeating the Eastern Conference champion Boston Celtics 4 games to 3 in the NBA Finals. Kobe Bryant was named NBA Finals MVP for the second straight year.\n\nOverview\nWestern Conference\nFor the 2nd time in 3 seasons and the first time since 2008, all Western Conference playoff teams had at least 50 wins. The 7 games separating 1–8 was tied for the smallest margin, also from 2008.\nThe Phoenix Suns returned to the playoffs after a one-season absence.\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder made their first playoff appearance since relocating from Seattle in 2008; the team's last appearance was as the Seattle SuperSonics in 2005.  They made the most of their debut playoff appearance, pushing the eventual champion Lakers to six games.\nThe Portland Trail Blazers, San Antonio Spurs, and Oklahoma City Thunder entered the playoffs tied with 50 regular season wins. The Trail Blazers won the overall tie breaker, and were seeded sixth. The Spurs and Thunder were seeded seventh and eighth, respectively.\n\nEastern Conference\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers entered the NBA Playoffs with the league's best record for the second straight season. Their 61 wins in the NBA was the smallest win total for best record since the Pacers won 61 in 2004. However, due to LeBron James joining the Miami Heat the following season, this would be the Cavaliers' last postseason appearance until 2015, which was also James' first season back with the Cavaliers.\nThe Boston Celtics, who won the Atlantic Division, entered the playoffs as a fourth seed. This would be the first time since 2008 that this occurred.\nThe Charlotte Bobcats made their first playoff appearance in franchise history, and the first in the Charlotte NBA team's history since 2002.\nThe Detroit Pistons missed the playoffs for the first time since 2001.\n\nFirst Round\nGames 3, 4, and 6 of the Lakers-Thunder series were the first playoff games ever played at Ford Center (the arena's former tenants, the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets, didn't play a single playoff game in the building).\nWith their first round win over the Chicago Bulls, The Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Bulls in a playoff series for the first time since The Shot.\nWith their first round win over the Dallas Mavericks, the San Antonio Spurs became the first seventh seed since 1998 (and fifth overall) to beat a second seeded team in a playoff series. This would not happen again until 2023, when the Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Memphis Grizzlies. In addition, the Spurs also avenged their own series losses to the Mavericks, who beat them twice in the previous four seasons. It was also the Spurs’ first series win against the Mavericks since 2003.\nWith their first round loss to the San Antonio Spurs, the Dallas Mavericks earned the dubious distinction of losing 3 first round series while holding the top 2 playoff seeds. They lost to the seventh-seeded San Antonio Spurs in 6. They have also lost a playoff series against the Seattle SuperSonics (1987, as the second seed) and the Golden State Warriors (2007, as the top seed).\n\nConference Semifinals\nWith a conference semifinals sweep over the seventh–seeded San Antonio Spurs, the Phoenix Suns defeated the Spurs in the postseason for the first time since 2000. Prior to this, the Spurs won the previous four meetings. The Suns also made the conference finals for the first time since 2006.\nWith a conference semifinals sweep of the Atlanta Hawks, the Orlando Magic became the third team in NBA history to go 8–0 through the first two rounds of the playoffs. As of 2024, this remains the Magic's most recent series victory.\nThe Cavaliers–Celtics series was extremely notable because marked the first time that each team lost a home playoff game by record margins: Boston lost Game 3 124–95; Cleveland lost Game 5 120–88. The Cavaliers' second round playoff exit (4–2 vs. Boston) was the earliest for the top seed since the Dallas Mavericks' first round loss to the Golden State Warriors in 2007. Game 6 of the same series was LeBron James’ last game with the Cleveland Cavaliers until 2014.\n\nConference Finals\nGame 5 of the Magic-Celtics series was the last game played at Amway Arena (formerly known as Orlando Arena and TD Waterhouse Centre).\nWith a Game 6 win over the Orlando Magic, the Boston Celtics advanced to the NBA Finals for the second time in three seasons. With the win, the Celtics avenged the Magic for last year's Game 7 loss. With the loss, the Magic, who last year upset the top-seeded Cavaliers in 6 (after they went 8–0 through the first two rounds), suffered the same fate as last season's Cavaliers by becoming the third straight team to go 8–0 through the first two rounds, only to lose in the conference finals.\nWith a Game 6 win over the Phoenix Suns, the Los Angeles Lakers advanced to the NBA Finals for the third straight season. In addition, the Lakers avenged the Suns for their first round losses in 2006 (in which the Lakers led 3–1 before losing the series) and 2007. The Suns would not return to the playoffs until 2021.\n\nNBA Finals\nThe 2010 NBA Finals featured a 2008 Finals rematch between the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers, marking the first time since 2005 that the last two NBA Champions met in the NBA Finals.\nThe 2010 NBA Finals would be the last NBA Finals featuring Kobe Bryant, Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, and Rasheed Wallace. It would also be the last NBA Finals to feature Phil Jackson as a head coach.\nWith a Game 7 win, the Los Angeles Lakers beat the Celtics, who defeated them in the 2008 NBA Finals, to win their 16th NBA Championship. The Lakers also became the third team under the 2-3-2 format to come back from a 3–2 deficit to win the final two games at home (the other two teams being their 1988 team and the 1994 Houston Rockets. The Lakers would not return to the NBA Finals until 2020, while the Celtics would not return until 2022.\n\nFormat\nThe 3 division winners and 5 other teams with the most wins from each conference qualified for the playoffs. The seedings are based on each team's record; however, a division winner is guaranteed to be ranked at least fourth, regardless of record.\n\nTiebreak procedures\nThe tiebreakers that determine seedings were:\n\nDivision leader wins tie from team not leading a division\nHead-to-head record\nDivision record (if the teams are in the same division)\nConference record\nRecord vs. playoff teams, own conference\nRecord vs. playoff teams, other conference\nPoint differential, all games\nIf there were more than two teams tied, the team that wins the tiebreaker get the highest seed, while the other teams were \"re-broken\" from the first step until all ties were resolved. Since the three division winners were guaranteed a spot in the top four, ties to determine the division winners had to be broken before any other ties.\n\nPlayoff qualifying\nEastern Conference\nWestern Conference\n— = Not Applicable\n\nHome-court advantage\nThe team with the better record earned the home-court advantage through any playoff round, regardless of seeding. (The NBA is the only one of the four major North American leagues that awards home advantage based strictly on record.)\n\nBracket\nTeams in bold advanced to the next round. The numbers to the left of each team indicate the team's seeding in its conference, and the numbers to the right indicate the number of games the team won in that round. The division champions are marked by an asterisk. Home court advantage in the NBA Finals does not necessarily belong to the higher-seeded team, but instead the team with the better regular season record (for example, the 4th seed in the Western Conference could have a better regular season record than the 3rd seed in the Eastern Conference and would therefore have home court advantage if the two met in the Finals); teams with home court advantage are shown in italics.\n\nFirst round\nAll times are in Eastern Daylight Time (UTC−4)\n\nEastern Conference first round\n(1) Cleveland Cavaliers vs. (8) Chicago Bulls\nThis was the sixth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Bulls winning the first five meetings.\n\n(2) Orlando Magic vs. (7) Charlotte Bobcats\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Hornets franchise winning the first meeting. Note that historical records of the original Charlotte Hornets franchise (later relocated and renamed the New Orleans Pelicans) from 1988 to 2002 are currently with the present Hornets/Bobcats franchise since the 2014–15 season.\n\n(3) Atlanta Hawks vs. (6) Milwaukee Bucks\nThe Atlanta Hawks quickly took control of the series by winning the first 2 games against the Milwaukee Bucks, without star center Andrew Bogut. But the Bucks managed to take the next 3 games, including a shocking Game 5 win in Atlanta, where they overcame a 9-point deficit in the final 4 minutes. However, Atlanta managed to stave off elimination in front of a raucous Bradley Center crowd, coming away with an 83–69 Game 6 victory. The Hawks then finished off the Bucks in Game 7 and advanced to the next round.\n\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Bucks winning two of the first three meetings.\n\n(4) Boston Celtics vs. (5) Miami Heat\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Celtics and the Heat.\n\nWestern Conference first round\n(1) Los Angeles Lakers vs. (8) Oklahoma City Thunder\nThis was the first playoff game at Ford Center in Oklahoma City\n\nPau Gasol tip-in hits the series-winning shot after his teammate Kobe Bryant's miss.\n\nThis was the eighth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning five of the first seven meetings. All previous meetings took place while the Thunder franchise were still known as the Seattle SuperSonics.\n\n(2) Dallas Mavericks vs. (7) San Antonio Spurs\nThe Mavs won 55 games and the Southwest Division title, but for the 3rd time in four years, they failed to escape the first round. The 2007 Mavericks were defeated by the Golden State Warriors as a No. 1 seed, and the 2008 Mavericks lost in the 1st round to the New Orleans Hornets. The Mavs took Game 1 in Dallas, but would go on to drop the next three games (including two in San Antonio) to wind up trailing 3 to 1. Dallas won Game 5 to keep their season alive, but the Spurs managed to finish them off with a 10-point win in Game 6.\n\nThis was the fifth playoff meeting between these two teams, with each team winning two series apiece.\n\n(3) Phoenix Suns vs. (6) Portland Trail Blazers\nThis was the seventh playoff meeting between these two teams, with each team winning three series apiece.\n\n(4) Denver Nuggets vs. (5) Utah Jazz\nGame 6 is Carmelo Anthony's final playoff game with the Nuggets before being traded to the New York Knicks shortly before the trade deadline.\n\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Jazz winning two of the first three meetings.\n\nConference semifinals\nEastern Conference semifinals\n(1) Cleveland Cavaliers vs. (4) Boston Celtics\nThe Cavaliers were considered heavy favorites coming in, but had to rally from an 11-point halftime deficit to win Game 1. The Celtics took home-court in Game 2, as Celtics point guard Rajon Rondo's 19 assists powered them past the Cavaliers to an 18-point victory. The Cavaliers struck back in Game 3 and handed the Celtics their worst home-playoff loss in franchise history. Cavaliers forward LeBron James scored 21 points in the first quarter alone and 38 for the game. Antawn Jamison added another 20. Celtics forward Paul Pierce called the loss \"embarrassing\". Rondo's triple-double (29 points, a career playoff high 18 rebounds and 13 assists) pushed the Celtics to a Game 4 victory. The Celtics reciprocated their Game 3 humiliation with a 32-point victory in Cleveland during Game 5. LeBron James was held to 3 of 14 shooting. The Celtics clinched the series in Game 6, holding James to 8 of 21 shooting.\nThe Cavaliers early exit led to James's departure for the Miami Heat during the offseason. Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert then accused James of quitting on the team during the series and also alleged that he did the same thing the previous year's Conference Finals. The Cavaliers did not make the playoffs again until the 2014–2015 NBA season (James' first season back in Cleveland), and in fact, they would be the first team Byron Scott failed to take to the playoffs during his tenure as head coach; he had led his two previous teams to the playoffs at least once.\n\nThis was the fifth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Celtics winning three of the first four meetings.\n\n(2) Orlando Magic vs. (3) Atlanta Hawks\nThe Magic's victory was the most lopsided four-game sweep in playoff history.\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Magic winning the first meeting.\n\nWestern Conference semifinals\n(1) Los Angeles Lakers vs. (5) Utah Jazz\nGame 4 is Jerry Sloan's final playoff game as head coach of the Utah Jazz before he was resigned midway through the 2010–11 season.\n\nThis was the sixth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning three of the first five meetings.\n\n(3) Phoenix Suns vs. (7) San Antonio Spurs\nThis was the tenth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Spurs winning six of the first nine meetings.\n\nConference finals\nEastern Conference finals\n(2) Orlando Magic vs. (4) Boston Celtics\nThe Boston Celtics were able to hold off a late Magic rally to steal home-court advantage in Game 1. They even used that momentum to grab Game 2 in Orlando to take a 2–0 lead going into Boston. After winning back-to-back road games to begin a series for the first time in franchise history, the Celtics would go on to blow out the Magic by 23 points in Game 3 to take a 3 to nothing lead. The Magic, however, would rally for a desperate Game 4 victory in overtime to force Game 5 in Orlando. Dwight Howard poured in 32 points in that victory. The Celtics seemed to lose control of the series, as the Magic scored another victory in Game 5, making the series 3–2, to force it back to Boston. Boston fans began to become anxious, especially after recently seeing the NHL's Boston Bruins lose their playoff series against the Philadelphia Flyers even though the Bruins had a 3–0 lead initially.  No team in NBA history has rallied from a 3–0 deficit to win a post-season series. However, Orlando fell short as the Celtics were able to advance to the NBA Finals for the second time in three years with a 12-point win in Game 6.\n\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Magic winning the first two meetings.\n\nWestern Conference finals\n(1) Los Angeles Lakers vs. (3) Phoenix Suns\nThe Lakers put their home-court advantage to good use by winning the first two games at home. The Suns struck back to tie the series by taking Games 3 & 4 in Phoenix, but after a heart-breaking loss in Game 5 in which Ron Artest followed a missed airball by Kobe Bryant and hit the game-winner at the buzzer, the Suns found themselves trailing 3–2. Los Angeles held off a late Suns rally to steal Game 6 in Phoenix, as Kobe poured in 37 points, including a long jump shot in the final minute that put the game out of reach.\n\nGame 6 is Amar'e Stoudemire's final game with the Suns before he signed with the New York Knicks following the season.\n\nThis was the 12th playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning seven of the first 11 meetings.\n\nNBA Finals: (W1) Los Angeles Lakers vs. (E4) Boston Celtics\nAll times are in Eastern Daylight Time (UTC−4)\n\nThis was the 12th playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Celtics winning nine of the first 11 meetings.\n\nStatistic leaders\nSee also\nNBA records\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n2010 NBA Playoffs at NBA.com\nESPN's NBA page\n2010 NBA Playoffs at Basketball Reference",
    "2011 NBA playoffs": "The 2011 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 2010–11 season. The tournament concluded with the Western Conference champion Dallas Mavericks defeating the Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat 4 games to 2 in the NBA Finals. Dirk Nowitzki was named NBA Finals MVP.\n\nOverview\nWestern Conference\nThe San Antonio Spurs entered their fourteenth consecutive postseason. They also entered as the top seed in the Western Conference for the first time since 2006, in addition to entering the postseason with 50+ regular season wins for the twelfth consecutive season.\nThe two-time defending champions, the Los Angeles Lakers entered their sixth consecutive postseason. However, this would be their first since 2007 without posting the top seed in the Western Conference.\nThe Dallas Mavericks entered their eleventh consecutive postseason, and their eleventh straight appearance having won 50+ games in the regular season.\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder entered the playoffs with their first Northwest Division title under this incarnation.\nThe Denver Nuggets entered their eighth consecutive postseason and their first since 1995 without Carmelo Anthony on the roster.\nThe Portland Trail Blazers entered their third consecutive postseason.\nThe New Orleans Hornets also returned to the playoffs for the third time in four seasons. However, this was also their final postseason appearance before the franchise was renamed the Pelicans before the 2013–14 season. They lost in the first round to the Los Angeles Lakers in six games, and would not return to the playoffs until 2015.\nThe Memphis Grizzlies also made the playoffs for the first time since 2006. Unlike their previous three appearances, in which they were swept in the first round, The Grizzlies broke their trend by winning Game 1 of their series against the Spurs, their first playoff win in franchise history.\nThe Phoenix Suns, despite a run to the Western Conference finals last postseason, missed the playoffs for the second time in three seasons. This would also mark the start of a ten-season postseason drought for the Suns.\nThe Utah Jazz missed the playoffs for the first time since 2006.\n\nEastern Conference\nThe Chicago Bulls achieved several \"firsts\" since 1998: the East's best record, a Central Division title, and over 60 victories. They also clinched the NBA's best record for the first time since 1997, guaranteeing home-court advantage throughout the playoffs.\nThe Miami Heat entered their third consecutive postseason, and their first in the Big 3 era of Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, and Chris Bosh. They would also open the playoffs at home for the first time since 2006. Their in–state rivals, the Orlando Magic, entered their fifth consecutive postseason. In addition, for the first time, both franchises would open their playoff runs at home.\nThe New York Knicks made the playoffs for the first time since 2004, but this was their first playoff appearance as an above-.500 team since 2001. However, they were swept by the Boston Celtics in the first round.\nThe Philadelphia 76ers appeared for the third time in four seasons. However, they lost in the first round to the Miami Heat.\nThe Indiana Pacers made the playoffs for the first time since 2006, despite posting a sub .500 record. However, they lost to the Chicago Bulls in the first round.\n\nFirst Round\nBy losing Game 1 of their series against the New Orleans Hornets, the Los Angeles Lakers joined the San Antonio Spurs as the first top seeds to lose an opening game of the playoffs since the 16–team playoff format was introduced.\nIn Game 1 of the first round series between the Orlando Magic and Atlanta Hawks Dwight Howard of the Orlando Magic tied a franchise record with 46 points (31 in the first half), tying Tracy McGrady's total in Game 2 of the 2003 First Round against the Detroit Pistons. This also marked the first home playoff game with new Amway Center (now called Kia Center)\nIn Game 4 of their first round series against the Dallas Mavericks, the Portland Trail Blazers overcame a 23-point deficit to tie the series at 2. However, the Mavericks would go on to win the series in six games, giving the Trail Blazers their sixth consecutive first round series loss. They would not return to the playoffs until 2014.\nWith their first round win over the Denver Nuggets, the Oklahoma City Thunder won their first playoff series since relocating from Seattle. This also marked the first playoff series win for Kevin Durant.\nWith their first round sweep of the New York Knicks, the Boston Celtics swept a best–of–7 playoff series for the first time since winning the 1986 Eastern Conference finals with a 4–game sweep of the Bucks; prior to the series win they had not swept a series overall since 1992, in Larry Bird's final season. However, they lost to the Miami Heat in the conference semifinals.\nWith their first round series victory over the Philadelphia 76ers, the Miami Heat won their first playoff series since 2006, when they last won the NBA Championship. It also marked the first playoff series win for Erik Spoelstra as a head coach.\nWith their first round series win over the Indians Pacers, the Chicago Bulls won their first playoff series since 2007.\nIn Game 6 of their first round series against the San Antonio Spurs, the Memphis Grizzlies followed up their first playoff win by winning their first playoff series. They became the fourth eighth seeded team to beat a top seeded team in the first round, and the second team to do so since the first round expanded to a best–of–seven format in 2003. The Golden State Warriors were the most recent team to accomplish this feat.\nWith their series loss to the Atlanta Hawks, the Orlando Magic became the first team coached by Stan Van Gundy to lose a first round playoff series.\nFor the first time since the current NBA Playoff format was introduced in 2003, no first-round series was pushed to a Game 7.\n\nConference semifinals\nThe Los Angeles Lakers and the Dallas Mavericks met in the playoffs for the first time since 1988. It also marked the lone postseason meeting that Kobe Bryant and Dirk Nowitzki would ever have. The series was extremely notable for the following reasons.\n\nGame 1: The Dallas Mavericks overcame a 16-point fourth quarter deficit to win the game.\nGame 2: The Los Angeles Lakers lost the first two games of a playoff series at home.\nGame 3: The Los Angeles Lakers blew a 7-point fourth quarter lead to lose 92–98.\nGame 4\nThe Dallas Mavericks set an NBA record with 20 three pointers (with Jason Terry shooting nine of them).\nAndrew Bynum and Lamar Odom getting ejected 45 seconds apart\nWith a 122–86 victory, the Dallas Mavericks not only swept the Los Angeles Lakers, but they also made the conference finals for the first time since 2006 (and fourth overall), and vindicated themselves following their shocking first round exit four years earlier.\nThis would also prove to be Phil Jackson's final game as an NBA head coach.\nTheir series loss to the Dallas Mavericks marked the Los Angeles Lakers' first series loss despite having home court advantage since 1996. It also marked Phil Jackson's first time being swept in a playoff series.\nGame 4 of the Heat–Celtics series was Shaquille O'Neal's final NBA game; he would announce his retirement three weeks later. It also marked the second time (the first being 2007) that his and Kobe Bryant's teams were eliminated in the same playoff series since the duo broke up in 2004.\nWith their conference semifinals win over the Atlanta Hawks, the Chicago Bulls returned to the conference finals for the first time since 1998, when they last made the NBA Finals.\nGame 7 of the Grizzlies–Thunder series also ensured a 12th straight postseason with at least one Game 7 played. The last without one was the 1999 NBA playoffs. The 2011 Playoffs also marked the first time since 2007 that only one series went to a Game 7. By winning this game, the Oklahoma City Thunder made their first Western Conference finals appearance since 1996 (when they were known as the Seattle SuperSonics), and their first under the current incarnation.\n\nConference finals\nFor the first time since 2007, no #1 or #2 seed participated in the Western Conference finals.\nWith their Western Conference finals series win over the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Dallas Mavericks returned to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2006.\nWith their Eastern Conference finals series win over the Chicago Bulls, the Miami Heat returned to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2006, guaranteeing an NBA Finals rematch with the Dallas Mavericks. It also marked the first time since 1990 that the Chicago Bulls lost an Eastern Conference finals series, and the first time since 1989 that the Bulls lost the ECF at home. As of 2024, this was the Bulls' most recent Eastern Conference finals appearance.\n\nNBA Finals\nIn a rematch of the 2006 NBA Finals, there were some extremely notable moments.\n\nGame 2: The Dallas Mavericks came back from a fifteen-point deficit to win the game, 95–93. Ironically enough, they held a nine-point lead in the first half before falling behind in the second half. LeBron James only scored two points in the final quarter.\nGame 4: LeBron James did not score any points in the fourth quarter as the Dallas Mavericks won, 86–83. Dirk Nowitzki, on the other hand, played despite having a fever.\nGame 5: LeBron James scored only two points in the fourth quarter for the third time in four games, allowing the Dallas Mavericks to take a 3–2 series lead back to Miami.\nGame 6: With the win, the Dallas Mavericks defeated the Miami Heat in six games to win the championship. The Dallas Mavericks also became the first team in NBA History to win the NBA Finals despite trailing 1–0 and 2–1 in the same finals series. Dirk Nowitzki, despite shooting 1 for 12 in the first half of the game, was Finals MVP. The Mavericks would not win another playoff series until 2022.\n\nFormat\nThe 3 division winners and 5 other teams with the most wins from each conference qualified for the playoffs. The seedings are based on each team's record. However, a division champion is guaranteed to be ranked at least fourth, regardless of their record and their winnings.\n\nTiebreak procedures\nThe tiebreakers that determined seedings were:\n\nDivision leader wins tie against team not leading a division\nHead-to-head record\nDivision record (if all tied teams are in the same division)\nConference record\nRecord vs. playoff teams, own conference (top 8 of the conference east/west) (including tied teams)\nRecord vs. playoff teams, other conference (top 8 of the conference east/west) (including tied teams) (this tiebreaker does not apply if 3 or more tied teams)\nPoint differential, all games\n\nPlayoff qualifying\nEastern Conference\nWestern Conference\n— = Did not achieve\nNotes\n\nBracket\nTeams in bold advanced to the next round. The numbers to the left of each team indicate the team's seeding in its conference, and the numbers to the right indicate the number of games the team won in that round. The division champions are marked by an asterisk. Home court advantage for the playoffs does not necessarily belong to the higher-seeded team, but instead the team with the better regular season record; teams with home court advantage are shown in italics. If two teams with same record met in a round use normal tiebreakers. Tiebreakers in NBA Finals are head-to-head and record vs opposite conference.\n\nFirst round\nAll times are in Eastern Daylight Time (UTC−4)\n\nEastern Conference first round\n(1) Chicago Bulls vs. (8) Indiana Pacers\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Bulls winning the first meeting.\n\nThis series pitted the team with the best record in the regular season against the team with the worst record in the playoffs. As such, this series was expected to be a very easy one for the Bulls. However, despite the Bulls winning 4–1, the series was more competitive than the outcome would indicate. Every game but the last was tightly contested; the first four games were each decided by six points or fewer. The series could easily have gone six or seven games had the Pacers been more successful in the closing moments of each of the first three games. However, the Bulls advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals for just the second time since the Michael Jordan era (the first being 2007).\n\n(2) Miami Heat vs. (7) Philadelphia 76ers\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Heat and the 76ers.\nThe newly revamped Heat, with the much-publicized off-season acquisitions of All-Stars and franchise players LeBron James and Chris Bosh, were heavy favorites going into this series against the Philadelphia 76ers. Along with Dwyane Wade, James and Bosh comprised the \"Big 3\" and were eager to show critics that they could compete in the playoffs after some slip-ups during the regular season (a 9–8 start, a five-game losing streak and a somewhat suspect record against the best teams in the league). However, many pundits believed that the end of the season showed the Heat playing the best they had all season. Although the Sixers offered some resistance, including some close losses and a come-from-behind victory in Game 4, the Heat were able to take it in five games and advance out of the first round for the first time since their NBA Championship in 2006.\n\n(3) Boston Celtics vs. (6) New York Knicks\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the 14th playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Celtics winning seven of the first 13 meetings.\n\nDue to the Celtics' struggles at the end of the regular season and the star power of the Knicks' Amar'e Stoudemire and Carmelo Anthony, many observers predicted a first-round upset victory for New York. In the first two games, the Knicks were indeed able to show they could contend with the defending Eastern Conference champions. In Game 1, Ray Allen made a game-winning three-pointer after being freed up by a controversial screen. The Celtics captured Games 3 and 4 fairly easily as injuries to both Stoudemire and Chauncey Billups took their toll on the Knicks. This was the only sweep of the first round.\n\n(4) Orlando Magic vs. (5) Atlanta Hawks\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Magic winning the first two meetings.\n\nDespite defeating Orlando in three of their four regular-season meetings, the Atlanta Hawks were considered underdogs entering this series against the Magic, led by Defensive Player of the Year Dwight Howard. The Hawks were utterly unable to contain Howard in the first game; he scored 46 points and grabbed 19 rebounds. However, by limiting the contributions of the Magic's role players, Atlanta garnered a victory and stole the home-court advantage from the Magic. Although Orlando won the next game, better play by the Hawks down the stretch and the inability of the Magic to convert three-point shots gave the Hawks a 3–1 lead (the Magic shot 2-of–23 from beyond the arc in Game 4). The teams split the next two games and the Hawks advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals for the third straight year.\n\nWestern Conference first round\n(1) San Antonio Spurs vs. (8) Memphis Grizzlies\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Spurs winning the first meeting.\n\nThe eighth-seeded Grizzlies won their first playoff game in franchise history by defeating the top-seeded Spurs 101–98 in Game 1. The Spurs evened the series in Game 2, but the Grizzlies won Games 3 and 4 to take a 3–1 lead. With San Antonio 1.7 seconds away from elimination in Game 5, Gary Neal connected on a three-point buzzer beater to force overtime. The Spurs would win in OT, 110–103. However, the Grizzlies defeated the Spurs in Game 6, 99–91, to win a playoff series for the first time. In so doing, Memphis became just the second eighth-seeded team to knock off a top-seeded team since the NBA began using a best-of-seven format in the first round.\n\n(2) Los Angeles Lakers vs. (7) New Orleans Hornets\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Lakers and the New Orleans Pelicans/Hornets franchise.\n\n(3) Dallas Mavericks vs. (6) Portland Trail Blazers\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Trail Blazers winning two of the first three meetings.\n\nThe Mavericks won the first two games, but the Trail Blazers won Games 3 and 4 to tie the series. Portland played most of Game 4 from behind, including trailing Dallas by 23 points late in the third quarter. Although the Mavericks held a 67–49 lead after three quarters, the Trail Blazers pulled off their biggest fourth-quarter comeback in franchise history and won, 84–82, behind 18 points from Brandon Roy in the final quarter. Dallas recovered quickly from their Game 4 collapse, however, winning Games 5 and 6 to eliminate Portland.\n\n(4) Oklahoma City Thunder vs. (5) Denver Nuggets\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Nuggets winning two of the first three meetings. All previous meetings took place while the Thunder franchise were still known as the Seattle SuperSonics.\n\nConference semifinals\nEastern Conference semifinals\n(1) Chicago Bulls vs. (5) Atlanta Hawks\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the fifth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the each team winning two series apiece.\n\n(2) Miami Heat vs. (3) Boston Celtics\nGame 4 is Shaquille O'Neal's final NBA game.\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Celtics winning the first meeting.\n\nThe series was seen as an opportunity for Heat small forward LeBron James to exact revenge on the Celtics after Boston eliminated James' former team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, in 2008 and 2010. James called the series \"personal\", saying \"...You don't want to keeping getting beat by the same team, the same team keep sending you home to plan a vacation...\"\nThe Heat won the first two games, but the Celtics won Game 3, 97–81. In that game, Boston point guard Rajon Rondo dislocated his left elbow on a bizarre play in the third quarter where he became tangled up with Dwyane Wade. Rondo still contributed to the Celtics' victory, scoring four points in the fourth quarter after the injury and finishing with 11 assists. However, his left arm was visibly limp for the remainder of the series and he was unable to play at his usual level of ability.\nMiami bounced back after the Game 3 loss to win the series, 4–1, returning to their first Eastern Conference finals since the 2006 NBA playoffs.\n\nWestern Conference semifinals\n(2) Los Angeles Lakers vs. (3) Dallas Mavericks\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning the first three meetings.\n\nThe Mavericks won the first two games in Los Angeles, including overcoming a 16-point deficit late in the third quarter of Game 1. Dallas overcame another second-half deficit to win Game 3, 98–92. In Game 4, the Mavericks blew out the Lakers, 122–86, sweeping the two-time defending NBA champions. Dallas equaled an NBA record in that game by sinking 20 three-pointers. Mavericks sixth man Jason Terry led the team in scoring with 32 points while making nine of his ten long-range attempts, tying another NBA playoff record that would go unequaled for nearly five years. Also in the same game, Andrew Bynum was ejected—and eventually fined and suspended for five games of the next season—after committing a flagrant foul on J. J. Barea.\nThis series was the one and only time a team coached by Phil Jackson was swept out of the NBA Playoffs.\n\n(4) Oklahoma City Thunder vs. (8) Memphis Grizzlies\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Grizzlies and the Thunder.\nThe Grizzlies and Thunder split the first two games. Memphis took a 2–1 series lead after overcoming a 16-point deficit late in the third quarter of Game 3. The Thunder tied the series back up in Game 4 with a 133–123 victory in triple overtime. Oklahoma City blew out the Grizzlies in Game 5, 99–72, but Memphis tied the series again in Game 6. The Thunder finally advanced to their first conference finals since they moved from Seattle by eliminating the Grizzlies in seven games. In the finale, Russell Westbrook became the fifth player to record a triple double in a Game 7.\n\nConference finals\nEastern Conference finals\n(1) Chicago Bulls vs. (2) Miami Heat\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the sixth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Bulls winning four of the first five meetings.\n\nChicago swept Miami in the regular season en route to the league's best record and also blew out the Heat in Game 1 of the conference finals, 103–82. However, Miami advanced to the NBA Finals by capturing the next four games. In Game 5, the Heat erased a 12-point deficit with three minutes remaining to eliminate the Bulls, 83–80.\nThis series marked the only time all season that the Bulls lost more than two consecutive games.\n\nWestern Conference finals\n(3) Dallas Mavericks vs. (4) Oklahoma City Thunder\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the third playoff series between these two teams, with each team having won one of the prior series. Both previous meetings took place when the Thunder franchise was still known as the Seattle SuperSonics.\n\nIn Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals, Dirk Nowitzki of Dallas set a playoff record for most free throws made without a miss with 24, previously held by Paul Pierce (21) in 2003. The Mavericks won, 121–112. The Thunder and Mavericks then split the next two games. In Game 4, Dallas rallied from a 15-point deficit with five minutes left in regulation to win in overtime for a 3–1 series lead. The Mavericks then wiped out another deficit late in Game 5 to win the game, 100–96, and reach their first NBA Finals since 2006. It would be the last time that neither a #1 seed nor a #2 seed reached a Conference finals until 2020.\n\nNBA Finals: (E2) Miami Heat vs. (W3) Dallas Mavericks\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Heat winning the first meeting.\n\nStatistic leaders\nSee also\nNBA records\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\n2011 playoffs at NBA.com\n2011 NBA Playoffs at ESPN\n2011 NBA Playoffs at Basketball Reference",
    "2012 NBA playoffs": "The 2012 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 2011–12 season. The tournament concluded with the Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat defeating the Western Conference champion Oklahoma City Thunder, 4 games to 1 in the NBA Finals. LeBron James was named NBA Finals MVP.\n\nOverview\nWestern conference\nThe Los Angeles Clippers made the playoffs for the first time since 2006, while the Utah Jazz returned after a one-year hiatus. It was also Utah's first postseason appearance without Jerry Sloan as head coach since 1988. Ironically, both teams would be swept by the San Antonio Spurs.\nThe San Antonio Spurs entered their fifteenth consecutive postseason, continuing the longest active playoff streak at the time.\nThe defending champion Dallas Mavericks entered their twelfth consecutive postseason, the second longest active playoff streak in the Western Conference.\nThe Memphis Grizzlies earned home–court advantage for the first time in franchise history.\n\nEastern conference\nAll eight teams were the same from 2011. They also all had records over .500, the first time since 2005.\nThe Orlando Magic entered their sixth consecutive postseason, the longest active postseason streak in the eastern conference at the time. Their in–state rivals, the Miami Heat entered their fourth consecutive postseason. The Orlando Magic and Miami Heat gained notoriety for opening their postseason runs against the Indiana Pacers and New York Knicks despite recent tragedies rocking their respective cities. The Orlando Magic opened their NBA Playoffs against the Indiana Pacers just 2 months after the killing of Trayvon Martin in nearby Sanford, Florida, just 30 miles from where they play their games at Amway Center. Meanwhile, the Miami Heat opened their NBA Playoffs against the New York Knicks just 15 days after a drunk driver caused a devastating crash in southwest Miami-Dade County, just 18 miles from where they play their games at American Airlines Arena.\nThe Indiana Pacers opened the playoffs at home for the first time since 2004.\nThe New York Knicks and Philadelphia 76ers entered their second consecutive postseason.\n\nFirst round\nFor the first time since 2000, the Miami Heat and the New York Knicks met in the postseason, reigniting the Heat–Knicks rivalry.\nFor the fourth time since 2006, a division winner (in this case the Atlantic Division champion Boston Celtics) opened the playoffs on the road. Despite not having home court advantage, the Boston Celtics beat the Atlanta Hawks in six games. The Hawks would not open the playoffs at home again until 2015.\nGame 1 of the Bulls–Sixers series was extremely notable as Derrick Rose tore his ACL in the waning minutes of the Bulls’ 103–91 victory.\nWith their Game 3 loss to the Miami Heat, the New York Knicks lost their 13th straight playoff game, breaking Memphis' record from 2004 to 2006 for the longest playoff losing streak. However, they broke that streak with a Game 4 victory against The Heat at Madison Square Garden.\nWith their Game 4 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder, the defending champions Dallas Mavericks were swept in the first round, becoming the third defending champion to be swept in the First Round after the Philadelphia Warriors in 1957 and Miami Heat in 2007, and second after Miami to be done so in a seven-game series. It was the first time the Mavericks were swept in a seven-game series, and only their second sweep since 1990.\nWith their Game 5 win against the New York Knicks, the Miami Heat beat their arch rivals in a playoff series for the first time since 1997. During the series, however, the Knicks lost Baron Davis and Iman Shumpert to knee injuries.\nWith their Game 5 win against the Orlando Magic, the Indiana Pacers won their first playoff series since 2005. The Magic would not return to the postseason until 2019.\nWith their Game 6 win over the Chicago Bulls, the eighth–seeded Philadelphia 76ers became only the 5th eighth seeded team in NBA history to beat a top seed in the first round. Following the Grizzlies' 2011 upset of the 1st–seeded Spurs, this marked the first time in straight seasons an 8th–seed upset a #1 seed. In addition to losing Rose, the Bulls also lost Joakim Noah to injury during the series. This was the most recent occurrence of an eighth seed eliminating a top seed in the first round of the playoffs until 2023, when the eighth-seeded Miami Heat knocked out the top-seeded Milwaukee Bucks.\nGame 7 of the Lakers–Nuggets series ensured a 13th straight postseason with at least one Game 7 played. The last without one was the 1999 NBA playoffs.\nWith their Game 7 win over the Memphis Grizzlies, the Los Angeles Clippers won their first playoff series since 2006.\n\nConference semifinals\nDuring their conference semifinals series against the Indiana Pacers, the Miami Heat lost Chris Bosh to injury (although he would return in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals). As a result, the Heat fell behind two games to one before reeling off three straight wins to beat the Pacers in six games.\nFor the first time since 1999, back to backs were played in the conference semifinals, thanks to the Los Angeles Lakers and the Los Angeles Clippers sharing the same arena to avoid scheduling conflicts. It also marked the first time both Los Angeles teams appeared in the Conference Semifinals in the same season. As of 2023, this was the most recent occurrence of back to backs being played in the same postseason.\nWith their Game 4 win over the Los Angeles Clippers, the San Antonio Spurs became the fourth team in NBA History (and first in the Western Conference) to go 8–0 through the first two rounds of the playoffs. The Heat in 2005, Cavs in 2009 and Magic in 2010, also went 8–0 through the first two rounds. In addition, all 3 lost Game 1 of their Conference Finals. The Spurs broke this trend with a Game 1 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference Finals.\nGame 5 of the Lakers-Thunder series was Kobe Bryant's final NBA playoff game. In addition, this was also his final NBA Playoff appearance before his retirement in 2016.\nWith their Game 7 win over the Philadelphia 76ers, the Boston Celtics returned to the Conference Finals for the third time in five seasons. With the loss, the Philadelphia 76ers suffered the same fate as last season's Memphis Grizzlies by beating a top seed, taking their fourth seed opponent to a Game 7, only to lose on the road. The 76ers would not return to the playoffs until 2018.\n\nConference finals\nFor the third consecutive season, the Miami Heat and the Boston Celtics met in the postseason.\nWith their Game 2 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder, the San Antonio Spurs won 20 straight games. As a result, they set an NBA record for the longest winning streak carried over from the regular season to the playoffs, which was broken with the Game 3 loss, and finished a win short of tying the longest unbeaten playoff run in a single postseason.\nGame 5 of the Heat-Celtics series was notable for the return of Chris Bosh and the Boston Celtics overcoming a 2–0 series deficit to take a 3–2 lead going back to Boston. However, the Miami Heat would force a Game 7 thanks to LeBron James’ 45 point Game 6 performance in the Miami Heat's 98–79 win at TD Garden.\nWith a Game 6 win over the San Antonio Spurs, the Oklahoma City Thunder returned to the NBA Finals for the first time since 1996 (when they were known as the Seattle SuperSonics). The Spurs, on the other hand, lost the series 4–2 despite leading 2–0.\nWith a Game 7 win over the Boston Celtics, the Miami Heat returned to the NBA Finals for the second straight season. It marked the first time a LeBron James-led team beat the Boston Celtics in a playoff series despite trailing 3–2. With the loss, this was the second time that the Celtics lost a playoff series despite leading 3–2. The Celtics would not win another playoff series, let alone return to the conference finals, until 2017.\nGame 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals was Ray Allen's last game as a member of the Boston Celtics, effectively ending their “Big 3 era,” which began in 2007.\n\nNBA finals\nThe 2012 NBA Finals had several noteworthy events.\nFor the first time since 1998, no team from California or Texas represented the western conference in the NBA Finals. Ironically, the Oklahoma City Thunder eliminated the last three Western Conference finalists: the Dallas Mavericks, the Los Angeles Lakers, and the San Antonio Spurs, all in sequential order.\nFor the first time in franchise history, the Miami Heat faced a team other than the Dallas Mavericks in the NBA Finals.\nGame 1 of the 2012 NBA Finals was the first NBA Finals game ever played in the State of Oklahoma. The Thunder won this game 105–94.\nWith a Game 5 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Miami Heat won their second NBA championship. By winning the 2012 NBA Finals, the Heat became the second team to win the NBA Finals by overcoming three series deficits (2–1 in the conference semifinals, 3–2 in the conference finals, and 0–1 in the finals) in the same playoffs. The last team to accomplish this feat was the 1995 Houston Rockets. It was also the third (and final time) under the 2–3–2 format that the home team won the middle three games of the NBA Finals.\n\nConnection with NBA lockout\nIn May 2012, with the Bulls, Knicks, and Heat losing players to injuries, then-Commissioner David Stern initially said there was no connection between the injuries and the lockout that compressed the regular season to 66-game in 124 days; however, he later backed off those comments, saying more research was needed.\n\nFormat\nThe 6 division winners and 10 other teams with the most wins from each conference qualified for the playoffs. The seedings are based on each team's record; however, a division winner is guaranteed to be ranked at least fourth, regardless of record.\n\nTiebreak procedures\nThe tiebreakers that determine seedings are:\n\nDivision leader wins tie from team not leading a division\nHead-to-head record\nDivision record (if all the tied teams are in the same division)\nConference record\nRecord vs. playoff teams, own conference\nRecord vs. playoff teams, other conference (only in 2-way tie)\nPoint differential, all games\nIf there were more than two teams tied, the team that wins the tiebreaker gets the highest seed, while the other teams were \"re-broken\" from the first step until all ties were resolved. Since the three division winners were guaranteed a spot in the top four, ties to determine the division winners had to be broken before any other ties.\n\nPlayoff qualifying\nEastern Conference\n— = Did not achieve\n\nWestern Conference\n— = Did not achieve\nNotes\n\nBracket\nTeams in bold advanced to the next round. The numbers to the left of each team indicate the team's seeding in its conference, and the numbers to the right indicate the number of games the team won in that round. The division champions are marked by an asterisk. Home court advantage belongs to the team with the better regular season record, regardless of seed. (If two teams with the same record meet in a round, the tiebreakers used are head-to-head and record vs. opposite conference.)  Teams with home court advantage are shown in italics in the chart below.\n\nFirst round\nAll times are in Eastern Daylight Time (UTC−4)\n\nEastern Conference first round\n(1) Chicago Bulls vs. (8) Philadelphia 76ers\nThe Bulls came into the playoffs as the first overall seed for the second straight year. The 76ers, meanwhile, came into the playoffs as the team with the worst record in the playoffs. The Bulls made quick work of the 76ers, winning Game 1. However, with the Bulls leading by 12 with 1:20 to go in the fourth, Derrick Rose tore his ACL and he was ruled out for the playoffs, putting the Bulls championship hopes in serious jeopardy. The 76ers took the next three games to put the Bulls on the brink of elimination. In Game 3, Joakim Noah was injured when he stepped on Andre Iguodala's foot, ruling him out for the next two games. The Bulls staved off elimination by winning Game 5 at home. In Game 6, with the Bulls up 1 with 7 seconds to go, Ömer Aşık missed two crucial free-throws. Iguodala managed to rebound the ball and sprinted to the other side of the court. He got fouled by Aşık while going for a shot. Iguodala gave the 76ers the lead by making the free-throws. The Bulls, who were out of timeouts, had one last chance to force a Game 7 but C. J. Watson's halfcourt heave bounced off the back of the rim, giving the 76ers the series. They advanced to the semifinals for the first time since 2003. The Bulls, meanwhile, became the fifth first-seeded team to be upset by the eighth-seed.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Bulls winning the first two meetings.\n\n(2) Miami Heat vs. (7) New York Knicks\nThe Heat defeated the Knicks in Game 1 by 33 points. Game 2 was much closer, even without Knicks' starting rookie guard Iman Shumpert who suffered an ACL injury the previous game, but the Heat still won by 10. In Game 3 in MSG, the Heat found themselves on the wrong end in the first half, trailing by as much as 11 points, before closing the half with a 7–0 run. The Heat led by 2 after the 3rd quarter. However, LeBron James quickly sparked an 8–0 run to start the 4th quarter, giving them a 10-point lead. The Knicks never recovered. James himself outscored the Knicks in the fourth, 17–14. By losing Game 3, the Knicks set a new league record by losing 13 straight playoff games, their last win coming April 29, 2001, in their series versus the Raptors. In Game 4, Knicks' starting guard Baron Davis injured himself in the third quarter and had to be carried off the court on a stretcher. But led by Carmelo Anthony's 41, the Knicks won 89–87, escaping a sweep as Wade's potential series-winning 3 missed at the buzzer. In Game 5, the Knicks started strong but Miami took over the rest of the way. The Heat led by 11 at the end of the first half. The Heat never squandered the lead, effectively sealing the game and the series with a 3-pointer by Battier that gave the Heat a 14-point lead with a minute left in the game. The Knicks were led by Anthony's 35. Amar'e Stoudemire, meanwhile, was plagued by foul trouble. He fouled out with about 4 minutes left in the game.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the fifth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Knicks winning three of the first four meetings.\n\n(3) Indiana Pacers vs. (6) Orlando Magic\nThe Pacers were considered the heavy favorites in the series as the Magic would try to defeat the Pacers without Dwight Howard. The Magic defied the odds in Game 1, as the Pacers went scoreless in the final 4 minutes of the game, allowing the Magic to go on an 11–0 run to finish the game and take a 1–0 series lead. The Pacers quickly took revenge, winning the next two games at home and on the road by an average of 19 points. Game 4 was close, with the game going to overtime. However, George Hill hit two free-throws with 2 seconds left to give the Pacers a 3–1 lead in the series. Game 5 was close throughout the first three quarters, with Magic taking a two-point lead heading to the 4th quarter. However, Indiana outscored the Magic 36–16 in the fourth to give the Pacers the series victory 4–1. This would be last playoff appearance for the Magic until 2019.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with each team winning one series apiece.\n\n(4) Boston Celtics vs. (5) Atlanta Hawks\nThe Hawks had homecourt advantage for the series despite being the lower seeded team by having the better season-record of the two; the Celtics took the 4th-seed by winning their division title. The Hawks won Game 1 by nine points, but the Celtics took the next three games, pushing the Hawks to the brink of elimination. Games 2 and 3 were close victories for the Celtics with Game 4 being a blowout victory for them. Game 5 in Atlanta was a close one. In the final seconds, with the Hawks up by one, Rajon Rondo stole an inbound pass, giving the Celtics a chance to finish off the Hawks. However, Josh Smith stripped a Rondo pass intended for Kevin Garnett, letting the Hawks survive and force a Game 6. In Game 6, Garnett led the Celtics to an 83–80 victory and advance. The Hawks had a chance to tie the game through free throws. However, Al Horford missed his first free throw that could have cut the lead to one. It was the Hawks' only miss at the free throw line the entire night. He made his second to cut it to one and the Hawks quickly fouled Paul Pierce. Pierce made both free throws to extend Celtics' lead to 3. With a chance to tie the game, Jeff Teague fumbled a pass, sealing the series for Boston.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the 11th playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Celtics winning nine of the first ten meetings.\n\nWestern Conference first round\n(1) San Antonio Spurs vs. (8) Utah Jazz\nThe Spurs were touted the heavy favorites in the series, following their 10-game winning streak to end the regular season and their 3–1 season series victory over the Jazz. They quickly worked their way through the Jazz, scoring 31 points in the third quarter to blow the game open. They eventually won Game 1 106–91. In Game 2, the Spurs shot 10 three-pointers and shot more than 50% as they blew out the Jazz 114–83 to take a 2–0 series lead. Game 3 was close throughout the first half, with the Spurs leading only by 2 after the first half. However, the Spurs blew the game open in the second half and won by 12 to take a 3–0 lead in the series. The odds were stacked against the Jazz as no team in NBA history have managed to win a series after trailing 3–0. Notably, before Game 4 had even been played, Jazz forward Al Jefferson commented that he didn't think any team would defeat the Spurs In Game 4, it seemed like the Spurs would complete the sweep when they had a 21-point lead. However, the Jazz eventually cut the lead to just 4 with 49.4 seconds left in the fourth. However, Tony Parker and Manu Ginóbili eventually sealed the series by stealing the ball and scoring on a basket respectively. The Spurs eventually completed the sweep, winning Game 4 by 6.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the fifth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Jazz winning three of the first four meetings.\n\n(2) Oklahoma City Thunder vs. (7) Dallas Mavericks\nThe Mavericks came into the playoffs only as the 7th-seed, one of the lowest placements for a defending champion. Game 1 was a very close affair, with both teams going back and forth in the final minutes of the fourth quarter. However, Kevin Durant scored on a one-handed jumper with just about 1 second remaining. The Mavs still tried to win but Shawn Marion failed to get a shot off at the buzzer, giving the Thunder a one-point victory and a 1–0 series lead. Game 2 was also a close one but the Thunder held on and managed to squeak a 102–99 win and 2–0 series lead over the defending champs. In Game 3, the Mavs were no match for the Thunder, with the Thunder eventually blowing out the defending champs 95–79 to send the Mavs into the brink of a sweep. In Game 4, it looked as if the Mavs would stave off elimination when they led by 13 at the end of the third quarter. However, the Thunder outscored the Mavs 35–16 in the fourth and held on for a 103–97 victory over the Mavs. Following the sweep, the Mavs became just the 3rd defending champion to be swept in the first round.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Mavericks winning two of the first three meetings.\n\n(3) Los Angeles Lakers vs. (6) Denver Nuggets\nThe Lakers won the opening game 103–88 after Andrew Bynum had a triple-double with 10 points, 13 rebounds, and 10 blocked shots. The blocked shots broke Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's franchise record of nine, and tied the NBA playoff record set by Mark Eaton and Hakeem Olajuwon. Kobe Bryant scored 31 points and Pau Gasol added 13 points, eight rebounds and eight assists. The Lakers then won a close Game 2 but the Nuggets proceeded to blow out the Lakers in Game 3 99–84 to prevent the Lakers from taking a commanding 3–0 lead. Game 4 was close but Sessions and Blake hit pivotal 3's to put the Lakers in the lead for good and take a 3–1 series lead. Before Game 5, Bynum said that \"Close-out games are actually kind of easy.\" The Nuggets responded by taking Game 5 102–99. The game saw the Lakers erase a 90–75 deficit with 6:35 left in the fourth quarter. In Game 6, Bryant played despite having a stomach illness, but still managed to score 31 points. However, with little contribution from Gasol and Bynum, the Nuggets forced Game 7 with a 113–96 blowout win over the Lakers. The Lakers won the series 4–3, and avoided becoming the ninth team in NBA history to be eliminated after blowing a 3–1 series lead. Gasol had 23 points, 17 rebounds and six assists, Bynum had 16 points and a playoff career-high 18 rebounds, and Steve Blake scored a playoff career-high 19 points in a 96–87 win in Game 7. The Lakers blew a 16-point lead in the second half before Gasol put the Lakers ahead for good with a tip-in basket with 6:30 left. Kobe Bryant sealed Denver's fate by hitting a 3 with 48.3 seconds left to put the Lakers up 8. Denver had 19 turnovers in the game and shot just 7-of-27 in the fourth quarter. Returning from his seven-game suspension, Metta World Peace scored 15 points, while Bryant had 17 points, and 8 assists.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the sixth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning the first five meetings.\n\n(4) Memphis Grizzlies vs. (5) Los Angeles Clippers\nThe Clippers rallied to win Game 1 in one of the largest comebacks in playoff history. Trailing by as many as 27, and down 95–71 with 9:13 left, the Clippers held the Grizzlies to just one field goal the rest of the game and pulled off an improbable 99–98 victory before a stunned, sold-out crowd of 18,119 at FedExForum. In Game 2, the Grizzlies avenged their embarrassing Game 1 loss by winning a close Game 2 to even the series going to Los Angeles. In Game 3, the Clippers survived a late Grizzlies rally in the final minute as Rudy Gay's 3 missed at the buzzer to give the Clippers an 87–86 victory and a 2–1 series lead. Game 4 was close, with the game going to overtime. With Chris Paul's heroics, the Clippers managed to win Game 4 and take a commanding 3–1 series lead. Back at home for Game 5, the Grizzlies tried to stave off elimination, at one point taking a 24-point lead in the third before the Clippers cut the lead again. However, the Grizzlies made sure there would be no collapse, using a 7–1 run in the final 1:44 to win Game 5 92–80. Facing elimination on the road, the Grizzlies gathered themselves, storming back from an eight-point fourth-quarter deficit to win Game 6 90–88, to force a decisive Game 7. In Game 7, the Clipper bench outscored their Grizzlies counterparts, 41–11, and it was enough as the Clippers won on the road, becoming the 6th NBA road team to do so after leading series 3–1, to advance to the semifinals against the Spurs.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Clippers and the Grizzlies.\n\nConference semifinals\nEastern Conference semifinals\n(2) Miami Heat vs. (3) Indiana Pacers\nEven though the Heat won the regular season series, 3–1, this playoff series was expected to be a close one. In Game 1, the Heat took a major blow when Chris Bosh got injured in the first half. He was expected to be out for the rest of the series. However, James and Wade took over in the second half to give the Heat the win, 95–86. In Game 2, the Heat started strong, at one point taking a 9-point lead. The Pacers answered that by outscoring the Heat 28–14 in the third quarter to take an 11-point lead going to the fourth quarter. The Heat would come back, taking a 72–71 lead with 4:11 to go. However, with James and Wade missing key chances, the Pacers tied the series with a 78–75 win. Game 3 marked one of the worst playoff games for Wade, as he scored just 5 points on 2-of-13 shooting. Without Wade's contribution, the Heat found themselves down in the series 2–1 as the Pacers blew out the Heat, 94–75. Before Game 4, the Heat regrouped and refocused on the series. The result was a 101–93 victory over the Pacers in Game 4 to tie the series at 2–2. James scored 40 in the game, to go along with 18 rebounds and 9 assists. Wade recovered from his Game 3 performance by scoring 30. In Game 5, it was the Pacers who took the major blow when Danny Granger got injured in the second quarter by stepping on James's foot. He tried to come back in the third quarter but he aggravated his injury after fouling James. Then, after the third period, West left the game with a knee injury. Without Granger and West, the Pacers were unable to stop the Heat, as the Heat won 115–83 to take a 3–2 series lead, putting them a win away from the Eastern Conference Finals. In Game 6, West and Granger started for the Pacers despite their injuries. The Pacers started strong, even taking a 19–8 lead in the first quarter. However, the third quarter was decisive, with the Heat outscoring the Pacers 28–16 to take a 79–69 lead going to the fourth quarter. Led by Wade's 41 and James's 28, the Heat won three straight, 105–93, to take the series, 4–2.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Pacers winning the first meeting.\n\n(4) Boston Celtics vs. (8) Philadelphia 76ers\nThe Sixers came off fresh of an upset over the injury-laden Bulls. Both the Celtics and the Sixers clinched their first round series on the same day. In Game 1, Rondo had another triple-double, but the Sixers held a 10-point lead with 10:53 left in the fourth quarter. However, the Celtics eventually came back, winning Game 1 by a point to take a 1–0 series lead. On the final possession, the Sixers were unable to foul a speedy Rondo, who dribbled out the clock.  Game 2 saw the visitors lead for most of the game. With the Sixers leading 78–75 with 12 seconds to go, the Celtics squandered a chance to tie the game, as Garnett was called for an offensive foul. The Sixers then hit their final four free-throws to tie the series at 1 going back to Philadelphia. In Game 3, the Sixers held their last lead with 9:09 left in the second quarter as the Celtics took over the rest of the game to lead them to a 2–1 series advantage. In Game 4, the Celtics led by as much as 18 in the third quarter. Facing the prospect of trailing 1–3 in the series, the Sixers came back to take the game from the Celtics and tie the series going back to Boston. Game 5 saw Brandon Bass score 27 points, including 18 in the third quarter as the Celtics blew out the Sixers, 101–85, to push them a win away from the Eastern Conference Finals. Before the start of Game 6, Allen Iverson presented the game ball, prompting huge cheers from the crowd. It was enough to motivate the Sixers to defeat the Celtics 82–75 to force a Game 7. Jrue Holiday scored 20 points, including two free-throws with 31 seconds to go to put the game away. Game 7 was a tight contest, with the two teams going back-and-forth. Paul Pierce fouled out late in the fourth quarter, but Rondo had his second triple-double of the series, including a fourth quarter that helped the Celtics advance to the Conference Finals to face the Miami Heat.\nThis series is an important plot point in the 2019 film Uncut Gems, in which Garnett co-stars.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the 20th playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Celtics winning 11 of the first 19 meetings.\n\nWestern Conference semifinals\nThis is the first playoffs that the city of Los Angeles has both teams participating in the Conference Semifinals. The last time the Lakers and Clippers were in the Conference Semifinals was 1974, when the Clippers franchise was the Buffalo Braves. Also, another team based out of Staples Center, the National Hockey League's Los Angeles Kings, participated in the 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs. As a result of these 3 teams sharing one arena, Games 3 and 4 of the Thunder–Lakers and Spurs–Clippers series were played back-to-back on May 18–19 and 19–20 respectively, to avoid scheduling conflicts.\n\n(1) San Antonio Spurs vs. (5) Los Angeles Clippers\nThe Spurs won their last 14 games coming into this series. They were also well prepared because they were able to sweep their previous opponent, the Utah Jazz. Meanwhile, the Clippers were coming off a tough seven-game series against the Memphis Grizzlies and had to play Game 1 just 2 days after the Game 7 ended. Game 1 was close as the teams were tied coming into the 2nd quarter. However, the Spurs quickly took control in the 2nd and 3rd quarters as they defeated the Clippers, 108–92, and took a 1–0 series lead. Game 2 then saw a Spurs team taking control in the second half to defeat the Clippers and take a 2–0 lead. Going to Los Angeles for a back-to-back Games 3 and 4, the Clippers looked confident to defeat the Spurs, as they quickly took a 40–16 lead with 9:17 to go in the 2nd. However, the Spurs quickly cut the lead to 7 with 36.4 seconds before the half, with the half ending with a 10-point Clipper lead. Then, with the Clippers holding on to a 12-point lead with 9:39 to go in the 3rd, the Spurs unleashed a ferocious 24–0 run to take a 69–57 lead with 2 minutes to go in the 3rd. The Clippers never got closer than seven down the stretch as they watched the Spurs take a commanding 3–0 lead in the series. Game 4 was a close one, with the Clippers leading for much of the fourth quarter before the Spurs took the lead on a Duncan hook shot. Then, in the final moments of the game, Paul made several mistakes, a bad pass and an off-balanced jump shot that missed, that ultimately led to Clippers' demise. Following Parker's free-throw that extended the Spurs' lead to 3, the Clippers had one last chance. However, out of timeouts, the Clippers were forced to take a long inbound pass. Mo Williams managed to catch the ball but was unable to get a shot off as the Spurs completed the sweep of the Clippers. The Spurs became just the fourth team to go 8–0 through the first two rounds of the playoffs.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Clippers and the Spurs.\n\n(2) Oklahoma City Thunder vs. (3) Los Angeles Lakers\nMuch like the Spurs-Clippers series, the series featured a team that swept their first round opponents and another team that were coming off a tough seven-game series. As such, the Thunder had the advantage in Game 1. The result was a convincing 29-point blowout by the Thunder to the Lakers. The Thunder quickly took control through the first three quarters and stretched their lead to as high as 35. Game 2 was much closer, with the Lakers shocking the Thunder by leading by 7 with 2 minutes to go that would seemingly tie the series at 1. However, the Lakers would fail to keep the lead, with the Thunder eventually going on a 9–0 run to take a 2–0 series lead. In Game 3, the Lakers collaborated on both ends to prevent the Thunder from taking a 3–0 lead putting them back into the series. Game 4 saw the Lakers start strong, taking a 10-point lead at halftime. They were able to have a 13-point lead in the fourth. However, Thunder outscored the Lakers 25–9 the rest of the way to take a 3–1 series lead, putting the Lakers into the brink of elimination. With the score tied at 98, Russell Westbrook committed a crucial turnover when he slipped and lost the ball. However, Pau Gasol's pass was taken by Durant, setting up Durant's 3-pointer that gave the Thunder the lead for good. The Lakers still had one last chance to tie but Kobe Bryant's three missed, with Harden hitting two free-throws to effectively seal the deal. In Game 5, Lakers were able to keep the game close throughout the first three quarters before the Thunder closed the series on a flurry, starting with two threes by Durant with Westbrook converting an and-one layup to shift the momentum in favor of Oklahoma City. The Lakers were not able to respond as they watched the Thunder take the series, 4–1, to send the Lakers back home for the second straight season in the Conference Semifinals.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the ninth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning six of the first eight meetings.\n\nConference finals\nEastern Conference finals\n(2) Miami Heat vs. (4) Boston Celtics\nThis series marked the third straight year that the Heat and Celtics faced each other in the playoffs. They faced each other in the Eastern Conference First Round in 2010 (won by the Celtics, 4–1) and in the Eastern Conference Semifinals in 2011 (won by the Heat, 4–1). In addition, LeBron faced the Celtics for the third straight year in the playoffs. The LeBron-led Cavs also faced the Celtics in 2010 only to be defeated 4–2, which led to James' arrival on the Heat.\nIn Game 1, the Celtics started poorly, scoring only 11 points in the first quarter. The Heat had a 10-point lead after 1. The Celtics were hot in the second, scoring 35 points en route to tying the game at halftime. Behind a big second half, the Heat eventually defeated the Celtics 93–79 to take a 1–0 series lead. \nGame 2 was very different, with the Celtics starting very strong. Midway through the second quarter, a Rondo jumper extended their lead to 15. However, the Heat cut it to 7 at halftime. Miami had another big 3rd quarter. With the Celtics up 71–66 with 4:24 left in the third, a block by Wade on Allen ignited a 15–4 run by the Heat to end the quarter, as they took a 6-point lead heading into the fourth. The fourth quarter was close. With Miami leading 99–96 with 34 seconds left, Allen made a 3 to tie it. It eventually sent the game to OT, with James missing two chances to win the game. Miami eventually won 115–111 to take a 2–0 series lead. Rondo led the Celtics with a career-high 44 points, along with 8 rebounds and 10 assists. There was controversy in regards to the officiating as the Heat shot 18 more free throws, the Celtics committed 33 fouls to the Heat's 18, as well as a play in overtime in a tie game where Rondo was hit in the head by Wade and no foul was called, leading to a fast break dunk for Udonis Haslem. \nIn Game 3, the Celtics got strong performances from Rondo, Garnett, and Pierce. LeBron was also hot in the first quarter, scoring 16 points and making 7 of his first 9 shots. However, despite this performance, the second and third quarters were decisive, with the Celtics outscoring the Heat a combined 55–35 in the two quarters as they had an 85–63 lead heading into the fourth. Miami made a comeback, hitting 3's and dunks to cut the lead to 8. However, Boston held on for a 101–91 victory to make it 2–1. \nGame 4 was the same story, with the Celtics hitting several 3's and putting on a lead as big as 18. Miami tried another comeback in the third and fourth quarters. Unlike Game 3, they took the lead. Boston answered back, holding a 3-point lead in the final minute before James hit a 3 to tie it with 36 seconds left. This led to the second overtime game of the series. It was a low-scoring affair in OT, with both teams only making one field goal. With 4:22 left, Pierce fouled out, giving Miami a big chance. However, James fouled out with 1:51 left. The Celtics still held a 2-point lead in the dying seconds, but Wade missed a potential game-winning 3 at the buzzer, giving the Celtics a 93–91 win to tie the series going back to Miami. \nCeltics proceeded to lead the series, 3–2, with a 94–90 win in Game 5. In the game, Bosh returned for the first time since he got injured in Game 1 of the Heat-Pacers series but was not much of a help on the offensive end. He came off the bench in the game and scored 9 points and grabbed 7 rebounds in 14 minutes played. With the Celtics leading by 1 with less than a minute to go, Pierce knocked down a crucial three-pointer that gave the Celtics the lead for good. \nThe Heat prevented a celebration from happening in Game 6 with a 98–79 blowout win at Boston to send the series back to Miami for a seventh and deciding game. James had one of his best playoff games, scoring 45 points and getting 15 rebounds, 30 of his 45 came in the first half alone.\nIn Game 7, the Celtics started strong. In the second quarter, Garnett picked up his third foul, giving the Heat a chance to try and take a lead. However, Bass led a run that pushed the Celtics' lead to 11. The Celtics would still have a 7-point lead at halftime. The third quarter was decisive once again, letting the Heat tie the game going to the fourth quarter, which was even more decisive. With the Celtics leading by 1 with 8 minutes left, James had a dunk that gave the Heat the lead. It was soon followed by Bosh's third three-pointer of the night (a career-high three 3 pointers) that gave the Heat the lead for good. The Celtics never recovered as the Heat booked a return trip to the Finals with a 101–88 Game 7 win in Miami.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with each team winning one series apiece.\n\nWestern Conference finals\n(1) San Antonio Spurs vs. (2) Oklahoma City Thunder\nThis series would mark only the second time in the last seven years that the top two seeds from the Western Conference faced each other in the Conference Finals. Game 1 would be close, with the Thunder taking a 9-point lead going to the fourth, looking poised to give the Spurs their first loss of the postseason. However, the Spurs took control on both ends in the fourth quarter to stay perfect in the playoffs. In Game 2, the Spurs started strong, at one point in the third quarter taking a 22-point lead. The Thunder would try to climb back in the fourth quarter, eventually cutting the lead to 6 in the fourth quarter. However, the Spurs would answer every run, en route to a 120–111 win over the Thunder and a 2–0 series lead. Manu Ginobili sealed the deal by hitting a three-pointer that extended the Spurs' lead to 10 with about a minute and a half to go. With the win, the Spurs extended their 2012 playoff record to 10–0. This win also marked the Spurs' 20th consecutive win, tied for the 3rd longest winning streak in NBA history. It is also the longest winning streak that was carried from the regular season and into the playoffs. In Game 3, the Spurs were no match for the Thunder. Behind their thunder blue home crowd, the Thunder blew out the Spurs, 102–82, to give them their first 2012 postseason loss. Game 4 was much closer. In the fourth quarter, Kevin Durant scored half of his 36 points as the Thunder tied the series with a 109–103 win over the Spurs. In Game 5, the Thunder started strong, at one point in the second quarter taking a 13-point lead. The Spurs would still come back in the second half. Fueled by two threes from Ginobili, the Spurs took the lead back. However, the Thunder eventually outscored the Spurs 25–12 for the rest of the quarter to take a 9-point lead heading to the fourth quarter. After a Harden 4-point play that gave the Thunder another 13-point lead, things began to unravel as the Spurs staged an 11–0 run through the next 4 minutes to bring them back into the game. Then, with the Thunder holding on for a 103–101 lead with 28 seconds left, Harden came up big by hitting a crucial three-pointer to give the Thunder a 5-point lead. The Spurs would not give up. Following a Ginobili layup shot that cut the lead to 3, a fullcourt press by the Spurs forced a Thunder turnover, giving them a chance to tie the game. However, Ginobili missed a  three-pointer that sealed a 3–2 lead for the Thunder. In Game 6, the Spurs dominated early, outscoring the Thunder by 14 in the first quarter and holding a 15-point lead at halftime. Their largest lead of the game was 18. However the Thunder rallied in the 3rd quarter, outscoring the Spurs 32–18. With a few clutch shots by Derek Fisher and James Harden, the Thunder booked a trip to the Finals with a 107–99 comeback win over the Spurs. With the win, the Thunder advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time since moving from Seattle in 2008 and the franchise's first appearance in the NBA Finals since 1996, when the franchise was known as the Seattle SuperSonics.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Spurs winning the first three meetings.

    "2013 NBA playoffs": "The 2013 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 2012–13 season. The tournament concluded with the Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat defeating the Western Conference champion San Antonio Spurs 4 games to 3 in the NBA Finals. LeBron James was named NBA Finals MVP for the second straight year.\n\nOverview\nThe Miami Heat headed into the playoffs with a franchise–best  66 wins, topping the league in the regular season. Their 2012 Finals opponents, the Oklahoma City Thunder, topped the Western Conference with 60 wins, making it the first time since 2006 that the two teams who faced off in the previous year's finals topped their respective conferences in the next regular season.\nThis was also the final NBA Playoffs played under commissioner David Stern.\n\nWestern Conference\nThe San Antonio Spurs continued the longest active playoff streak at 16 straight appearances. The Dallas Mavericks missed the playoffs for the first time since 2000, ending the second-longest active streak of playoff appearances, which stretched 12 years.\nThe Los Angeles Clippers made franchise history by winning their first Pacific Division title and having a 56–win season, tied with the Memphis Grizzlies, whose 56 wins were also a franchise record. However, home court advantage went to the Clippers by virtue of winning their division. Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Lakers entered their eighth consecutive postseason. However, this was their first appearance since 1996 without Kobe Bryant, as he was out with injury.\nThe Denver Nuggets entered their tenth consecutive postseason. They also earned the West's third seed and headed into the playoffs with a franchise–record 57 wins.\nThe Golden State Warriors made their first playoff appearance since 2007, while the Houston Rockets made their first playoff appearance since 2009.\n\nEastern Conference\nThe Indiana Pacers won the Central Division for the first time since 2004, while the New York Knicks entered the playoffs with their best regular-season performance since 1997, finishing atop the Atlantic Division for the first time since 1994. The Knicks also opened the playoffs at home for the first time since 2001.\nThe Brooklyn Nets made the playoffs for the first time since 2007, when they were known as the New Jersey Nets, while the Milwaukee Bucks appeared for the first time since 2010. The Bucks were the first team since 2011 to make the playoffs despite finishing below .500 in the regular season.\nThe New York Knicks entered their third consecutive postseason. Their first round opponent, the Boston Celtics opened their postseason run just days after the Boston Marathon bombing, which occurred just blocks from where the Celtics play their games at TD Garden.\nThe Orlando Magic missed the playoffs for the first time since 2006, ending the longest active streak in the Eastern Conference. As a result, the Atlanta Hawks would own this distinction from 2013 to 2017.\n\nFirst Round\nGame 1 of the Bulls–Nets series marked the first time that Barclays Center hosted a playoff game. Game 7 of the same series also marked the 14th straight postseason with at least one Game 7. The 1999 NBA playoffs was the last time that a Game 7 was not played.\nWith their series sweep of the Milwaukee Bucks, the Miami Heat swept a playoff series for the first time since 2005. They also won every game by double digits.\nGame 3 of the Knicks–Celtics series was the first Celtics home game since the Boston Marathon Bombings.\nGame 4 of the Spurs–Lakers series was the final Lakers playoff game until 2020.\nWith their Game 6 win over the Boston Celtics, the New York Knicks won a playoff series for the first time since 2000.\n\nConference Semifinals\nFor the first time since 2000, the Indiana Pacers and the New York Knicks met in the postseason, reigniting the Knicks–Pacers rivalry.\nWith Oklahoma City's Game 5 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies in the Conference Semifinals, home court advantage in the Western Conference Finals went to the San Antonio Spurs, who were two games ahead of the Grizzlies. With the win, the Grizzlies made the conference finals for the first time in franchise history.\nWith their Game 6 win over the Golden State Warriors, the San Antonio Spurs returned to the Western Conference Finals for the second consecutive year.\nWith their Game 6 win over the New York Knicks, the Indiana Pacers made the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 2004. The Knicks would not return to the playoffs until 2021.\n\nConference Finals\nBy sweeping the Memphis Grizzlies in the Western Conference Finals, the San Antonio Spurs returned to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2007.\nFor the second consecutive postseason, the Eastern Conference Finals went to a Game 7. The Heat won the game, and earned their third straight berth in the NBA Finals.\n\nNBA Finals\nThe 2013 NBA Finals were extremely notable for several reasons.\n\nGame 2: LeBron James’ block of Tiago Splitter\nGame 5: Danny Green setting an NBA Finals record for three pointers made in a series.\nGame 6: The Miami Heat came back from a five-point deficit with 28.2 seconds in regulation to win the game in overtime. The highlights of the comeback, Ray Allen's game tying three pointer at the end of regulation and Chris Bosh's game winning block against Danny Green, rated Game 6 of the 2013 NBA Finals as one of the greatest NBA Finals games ever played.\nGame 7: The Miami Heat won their second consecutive NBA championship with a win over the San Antonio Spurs. The Spurs, on the other hand, lost an NBA Finals series for the first time in franchise history.\nThis was the last NBA Finals series ever played under NBA commissioner David Stern, and this was also the last time the NBA Finals were played in the 2–3–2 format. The format was reverted to the 2–2–1–1–1 format beginning in 2014.\n\nFormat\nThe six division winners and 10 other teams with the most wins from each conference qualified for the playoffs. The seedings are based on each team's record; however, a division winner is guaranteed to be ranked at least fourth, regardless of record.\n\nTiebreak procedures\nThe tiebreakers that determine seedings are:\n\nDivision leader wins tie from team not leading a division\nHead-to-head record\nDivision record (if all the tied teams are in the same division)\nConference record\nRecord vs. playoff teams, own conference\nRecord vs. playoff teams, other conference (only in two-way tie)\nPoint differential, all games\nIf there were more than two teams tied, the team that wins the tiebreaker gets the highest seed, while the other teams were \"re-broken\" from the first step until all ties were resolved. Since the three division winners were guaranteed a spot in the top four, ties to determine the division winners had to be broken before any other ties.\n\nPlayoff qualifying\nEastern Conference\n— = Did not achieve\n\nWestern Conference\n— = Did not achieve\nNotes\n\nBracket\nTeams in bold advanced to the next round. The numbers to the left of each team indicate the team's seeding in its conference, and the numbers to the right indicate the number of games the team won in that round. The division champions are marked by an asterisk. Home court advantage for the playoffs does not necessarily belong to the higher-seeded team, but instead the team with the better regular season record. Teams with home court advantage are shown in italics. If two teams with the same record meet in a round, standard tiebreaker rules are used. The doodle rule for determining home court advantage in the NBA Finals is head-to-head record followed by record vs. opposite conference.\n\nFirst round\nAll times are in Eastern Daylight Time (UTC−4)\n\nEastern Conference first round\n(1) Miami Heat vs. (8) Milwaukee Bucks\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Heat and the Bucks.\n\n(2) New York Knicks vs. (7) Boston Celtics\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the 15th playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Celtics winning eight of the first 14 meetings.\n\n(3) Indiana Pacers vs. (6) Atlanta Hawks\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the fifth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the each team winning two series apiece.\n\n(4) Brooklyn Nets vs. (5) Chicago Bulls\nThe Nets led wire-to-wire as they routed the Bulls 106–89 to take a 1–0 series lead.  A dominant first half allowed the Nets to put the game away early as they outscored the Bulls 25–14 in the first quarter and 35–21 in the second quarter, building a 60–35 halftime lead.  \n\nFollowing their embarrassing Game 1 loss, the Bulls bounced back with a 90–82 win, evening the series at 1–1 and stealing homecourt advantage.  The Bulls took control of the game in the third quarter, outscoring the Nets 22–11 in the period and building a 12-point 4th quarter lead.  The Nets attempted to rally, but the Bulls made enough clutch shots to hold them off.  After scoring 89 points through 3 quarters in Game 1 (and 106 for the game), the Nets were held to 82 points for all of Game 2.  \n\nThe Bulls took a 2–1 series lead with a 79–76 victory.  Despite squandering most of a huge fourth quarter lead, the Bulls hung on to win when Cj Watson airballed a game-tying three-pointer at the buzzer.\n\nThe Bulls stunned the Nets and took a commanding 3–1 series lead with a 142–134 victory in triple overtime.  The Nets trailed 58–55 at halftime.  However, they outscored the Bulls 29–18 in the third quarter and led by 8 points heading into the fourth quarter.  With less than 3 minutes to go, the Nets extended their lead to 14, and the Bulls trailed 109–95.  However, the Bulls would go on a 16–2 run to force the first of three overtimes.  Nate Robinson caught fire, scoring 23 points in the 4th quarter, including 12 unanswered points as the Bulls cut the deficit to 109–107 with just over one minute remaining.  Carlos Boozer then scored the game-tying bucket to even the game at 109.  On the Nets' next possession, Brook Lopez was fouled.  He made both free throws to put the Nets up 111–109.  The Bulls drew up a play to give Luol Deng a go-ahead corner three.  Deng missed the three, but Joakim Noah grabbed two offensive rebounds and tied the game at 111–111.  Deron Williams attempted to win the game at the end of regulation, but his shot rimmed out, and the Bulls forced overtime.  During the overtimes, several players fouled out.  For the Nets, Gerald Wallace and Reggie Evans would foul out while Robinson, Noah, and Gibson would foul out for the Bulls.  The Bulls would go on to win the game in triple overtime as they pushed the Nets to the brink of elimination.  \n\nThe Bulls entered this game without the services of Derrick Rose, Luol Deng, and Kirk Hinrich, but almost blew a 3–1 series lead to the Nets.  However, the Bulls dominated the first half, building a 61–44 halftime lead.  In the second half, the Nets fought back as they cut the deficit to 4, but they got no closer as the Bulls prevailed with a 99–93 victory.  It was the first time that the Bulls had won a Game 7 on the road in franchise history, becoming the 7th NBA road team to do so after leading series 3–1.  They were 0–6 in their last 6 road Game 7's. This was also Gerald Wallace's last game as a Net.   \n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Bulls winning the first meeting. All previous meetings took place while the Nets were in New Jersey.\n\nWestern Conference first round\n(1) Oklahoma City Thunder vs. (8) Houston Rockets\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the seventh playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Thunder/SuperSonics franchise winning five of the first six meetings. All previous meetings took place while the Thunder franchise were still known as the Seattle SuperSonics. In game 2, Russell Westbrook was injured.\n\n(2) San Antonio Spurs vs. (7) Los Angeles Lakers\nThe Spurs dominated the Lakers in Game 1 and took a 1–0 series lead.\n\nThe Spurs dominated again in Game 2 and took a commanding 2–0 series lead.\n\nThe Spurs throttled the Lakers 120–89 and took a commanding 3–0 series lead.  For the Lakers, the 31-point loss represented the largest home playoff loss in franchise history.\n\nThe Spurs completed their sweep of the injury-depleted Lakers, routing them 103–82.  Dwight Howard picked up two technical fouls and was ejected in the third quarter.  It would end up being his final game in a Lakers jersey until his return to the team in 2019.  \n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the 12th playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning eight of the first 11 meetings.\n\n(3) Denver Nuggets vs. (6) Golden State Warriors\nIn Game 1, Andre Miller hit the game-winning layup with 1.3 seconds left.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Nuggets and the Warriors.\n\n(4) Los Angeles Clippers vs. (5) Memphis Grizzlies\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Clippers winning the first meeting.\n\nConference semifinals\nEastern Conference semifinals\n(1) Miami Heat vs. (5) Chicago Bulls\nThe Bulls stunned the Heat in Game 1 with a 93–86 victory.  The game was close throughout, with neither team leading by more than 8 points.\nThe Heat entered the fourth quarter with a 62–58 lead and led 86–83 with just over two minutes to play when the Bulls scored the game's final 10 points.\nAfter giving up only 37 points in the first half, the Heat's defense allowed the Bulls to score 35 points in the 4th quarter alone.\nAfter Marco Bellinelli's game-tying three-pointer knotted the game at 86, Nate Robinson took over, scoring two consecutive shots to put the Bulls up 90–86 with just over 40 seconds left.  On the Heat's next two possessions, LeBron James would shoot an airball and miss a long three-pointer, and Nate Robinson made enough free throws to seal the win and help the Bulls steal homecourt advantage. \n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the seventh playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Bulls winning four of the first six meetings.\n\n(2) New York Knicks vs. (3) Indiana Pacers\nGame 6 is Jason Kidd's final NBA game.\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the seventh playoff meeting between these two teams, with each team winning three series apiece.\n\nWestern Conference semifinals\n(1) Oklahoma City Thunder vs. (5) Memphis Grizzlies\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Thunder winning the first meeting.\n\n(2) San Antonio Spurs vs. (6) Golden State Warriors\nGolden State led by 16 points with four minutes to go, but they would be hindered by missing eight of their last nine shots while the Spurs roared back to force overtime. The Spurs would come back without Tim Duncan, who had been bothered by a stomach virus and had to be in the locker room for the final 4:31 of regulation.  San Antonio finally tied the game on a Danny Green 3-pointer with 20 seconds left.  Stephen Curry (who scored 22 points in the 3rd quarter) would have a shot to win the game at the buzzer, but he missed a tightly contested 15-footer.  Manu Ginobili had a shot to potentially win the game at the end of the 1st overtime, but it was off the mark.  With 44 seconds on the game clock in double overtime, Ginobili missed a three-pointer that would have given the Spurs a six-point lead. Curry then made a two-point shot twelve seconds later to narrow the score to one. A missed layup by Tony Parker gave the Warriors the ball back; with three seconds to go, Kent Bazemore gave the Warriors the lead on a layup. However, Ginobili would shoot a three-pointer to give the Spurs the lead with one second remaining on the clock, and Jarrett Jack's running jumper shot missed at the buzzer to deliver a Spurs victory.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Warriors winning the first meeting.\n\nConference finals\nEastern Conference finals\n(1) Miami Heat vs. (3) Indiana Pacers\nPaul George hit the game-tying 3 with 0.7 left to send the game into OT, and then in OT, LeBron James hit the game winning layup at the buzzer to seal the Game 1 victory in Miami. He also had 30 points, and added 10 rebounds, 10 assists (his ninth career playoff triple double, tying him with Wilt Chamberlain for fourth all-time), and three blocked shots—the first such stat line in a playoff game since Ralph Sampson in Game 5 of the 1986 Western Conference Semifinals.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with each team winning one series apiece.\n\nWestern Conference finals\n(2) San Antonio Spurs vs. (5) Memphis Grizzlies\nThis was the first sweep of any NBA conference finals series since 2003, when the New Jersey Nets swept the Detroit Pistons.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with each team winning one series apiece.\n\nNBA Finals: (E1) Miami Heat vs. (W2) San Antonio Spurs\nGame 3 is Tracy McGrady's final NBA game.\nIn Game 6, Ray Allen hit the game-tying corner 3 with 5.2 left to force OT.\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Heat and the Spurs.\n\nStatistical leaders\nNBA Records\nThe following records were set or tied during the playoffs:\n\nOvertime in Postseason: The Heat's 103–100 overtime win vs. San Antonio on June 18, 2013, improved their all-time postseason overtime record to 8–1 (.889). Their .889 postseason winning percentage is the best among teams with at least three overtime games played and the second-highest among all teams.\nDouble-Digit wins in Postseason: The Heat's 16-point, 109–93, win in Game Four of the NBA Finals on June 13, 2013, was Miami's 12th double-figure win in the 2013 postseason. The 12 double-digit wins are the most by any team during a single postseason in NBA history. (Spurs tied this record in the 2014 NBA playoffs and all 12 of those victories would also be by 15+ points) The previous record was 11, held by five different teams, each winning the NBA Championship that postseason.\nHighest Field Goal Made Percentage, post season: Chris Andersen shot 80.7 percent (46-of-57) from the field in the 2013 postseason. He has become the first player in NBA postseason history to take at least 35 shots and shoot better than 75 percent from the field.\nConsecutive Finals games over 30 points: LeBron James scored 32 points in Game Six of the NBA Finals on June 18, 2013, and then made 37 points in Game Seven on June 20, 2013. According to Elias Sports Bureau, he became the first player in NBA history to score consecutive 30-point games to help rally his team from a 3–2 series deficit to win an NBA title.\nGame 7 over 30 Points: LeBron James finished the 2013 postseason by recording his fourth-straight 20-point Game Seven by scoring 37 points vs. the Spurs in the NBA Finals. He had previously scored 32 points vs. the Pacers on June 3, 2013, 31 points vs. the Celtics on June 9, 2012, and 45 points vs. the Celtics on May 18, 2008. The Elias Sports Bureau reports he has tied the record of the only other player to score at least 30 points in four consecutive Game 7's, Elgin Baylor (33 on 3/26/60, 39 on 4/1/61, 41 on 4/18/62, 35 on 4/11/63 and 33 on 4/15/66).\nHighest scoring average in game sevens: LeBron James is averaging 34.4 points in Game 7's of the postseason during his career, currently the best average in NBA history.\nMost 3-point FG in Postseason: Ray Allen owns the record for most 3-point field goals in the postseason – 385.\nMost 4 point plays in a Finals game, 2: On June 16, 2013, Ray Allen converted two free throws after making three-point field goals, one at the 5:08 mark in the 2nd quarter, and the other with 8:37 left in the 4th quarter. There had previously been only 12 four point plays in the NBA Finals history.\nTeam Leader in Points, Rebounds, and Assists: LeBron James' 18 points, 18 rebounds and 10 assists vs. San Antonio on June 6, 2013, was the 28th time he has led his team outright (no ties) in each of those categories during the playoffs, the most in NBA postseason history. In addition, he has been the outright game-high leader (no ties) in each of those categories eight times, also the most in NBA postseason history. His eight such games are more than the combined total of the next three players to achieve the feat.\n25-10-8: LeBron James' 32 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists vs. SA on June 18, 2013, marked his 15th postseason 25-point, 10-rebound, eight-assist game, the most in NBA postseason history. According to Elias, second on this list is Oscar Robertson with 10 such games.\nMost Three Pointers In A Final Series: On June 16, 2013, Danny Green converted 25 three-pointers through 5 games of the 2013 NBA Finals, breaking Ray Allen's record of 22 three-pointers that he had set in the 2008 Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers.  He extended the record to 27 three-pointers, converting two three-pointers (one per game) on June 18 and June 20.  However, the Heat won the series 4–3.\n\nSee also\nNBA records\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n2013 NBA Playoffs at NBA.com\n\"2013 NBA Playoffs at ESPN\".

    "2014 NBA playoffs": "The 2014 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 2013–14 season. The tournament concluded with the Western Conference champion San Antonio Spurs defeating the two-time defending NBA champion and Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat 4 games to 1 in the NBA Finals. Kawhi Leonard was named NBA Finals MVP.\n\nOverview\nThe 2014 NBA Playoffs marked the final postseason that the NBA Playoffs and Finals logos were applied on the qualifiers' courts  until 2020, when digital logos were used instead of decals. They were also the first playoffs overseen by Commissioner Adam Silver.\n\nWestern Conference\nThe San Antonio Spurs continued the longest active playoff streak in the NBA at 17 straight appearances.\nAll three teams from Texas made the playoffs for the first time since 2009.\nThe Dallas Mavericks returned to the playoffs after a one-season absence while the Portland Trail Blazers returned to the playoffs for the first time since 2011.\nThe Denver Nuggets missed the playoffs for the first time since 2003.\nThe Los Angeles Lakers also missed the playoffs for the first time since 2005.\n\nEastern Conference\nThe Atlanta Hawks, despite holding a sub–.500 record, made the playoffs for the seventh consecutive postseason, continuing the longest active postseason streak in the Eastern Conference.\nThe Toronto Raptors and Washington Wizards made their first playoff appearances since 2008.\nThe Charlotte Bobcats made their final playoff appearance before renaming themselves the Hornets, returned after a four-year absence.\nThe New York Knicks missed the playoffs for the first time since 2010. The Boston Celtics also missed the playoffs for the first (and only) time since 2007. For the first time since 1994, the Lakers and Celtics missed the playoffs in the same season. In addition, this was the first time in NBA history that the Knicks, Celtics, and Lakers missed the playoffs in the same year.\n\nFirst Round\nThe first round of the 2014 Playoffs is generally considered one of the greatest postseason rounds in NBA history. The first 11 days of the playoffs saw at least one road team win. That ended on April 30 with the Raptors, Spurs, and Houston Rockets all winning at home against the Brooklyn Nets, Dallas Mavericks, and Portland Trail Blazers, respectively. The 24 road wins is an NBA playoffs record for the first round. In addition, the 2014 playoffs featured a record eight first-round games that went into overtime, including four straight between the Memphis Grizzlies and Oklahoma City Thunder (Games 2–5), another NBA record.\nThis postseason and the previous year's postseason marked the first time since the 2000 and 2001 playoffs that both number 5 seeds knocked out both number 4 seeds in back–to–back years. The Washington Wizards eliminated the Chicago Bulls 4-1 while the Portland Trail Blazers eliminated the Houston Rockets 4–2.\nGame 6 of the Rockets–Trail Blazers series was highlighted by Damian Lillard's series winning three pointer over Chandler Parsons to win the game and the series. With the win, the Trail Blazers won their first playoff series since 2000.\nThe Hawks–Pacers series was the first series to force a Game 7, making this postseason the 15th consecutive postseason to have at least one Game 7. The 1999 NBA playoffs were the last time a Game 7 wasn't played.\nFive of the eight first–round series were extended to game sevens. Three of the series, Atlanta Hawks at Indiana Pacers, Memphis Grizzlies at Oklahoma City Thunder, and Golden State Warriors at Los Angeles Clippers, were played on May 3, which marked the first time (and currently only) in NBA history that three Game 7s were played on the same day. Two other game sevens were played on the following day, featuring Dallas at San Antonio and Brooklyn at Toronto. The five game sevens in the first round already tied the record for the most number of game sevens in any NBA playoffs, set in the 1994 NBA playoffs. However, the NBA only adopted a best–of–seven format for the first round beginning in 2003.\nGame 7 of the Raptors–Nets series was the first Game 7 ever played outside the United States. The Nets won this game, thanks to Paul Pierce's series winning block over Kyle Lowry. This would be the last Game 7 won by a road team until the 2016 NBA Finals.\n\nConference Semifinals\nGame 4 of the Heat–Nets series saw LeBron James record a Heat franchise playoff high 49 points. He eventually led the Miami Heat to their fourth consecutive Eastern Conference Finals appearance with a win in Game 5.\nWith a Game 5 win over the Portland Trail Blazers, the San Antonio Spurs advanced to the Western Conference Finals for the third consecutive postseason.\nWith a Game 6 win over the Washington Wizards, the Indiana Pacers made the Eastern Conference Finals for the second consecutive postseason. This also marked the first time since 1998–2000 that the Pacers made the ECF in consecutive seasons. This would be last playoff series victory by the Pacers until 2024\n\nConference Finals\nThis year's conference finals marked the first postseason (and the seventh time since 1972, when the current playoff system was put in place) in which the top two seeds played in the Conference Finals both in the East and the West.\nWith their Game 2 win over the Indiana Pacers, the Miami Heat set an NBA record by recording their 15th straight playoff series in which they earned at least one road win.\nWith their Game 6 win over the Indiana Pacers, the Miami Heat made the NBA Finals for the fourth straight season. The Heat were the first team other than the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers to accomplish this feat.\nWith their Game 6 overtime win over the Oklahoma City Thunder, the San Antonio Spurs made the NBA Finals for the second straight season. This marked the first time in franchise history that the Spurs made the Finals in consecutive seasons.\n\nNBA Finals\nThe 2014 NBA Finals were notable for several things.\nFor the first time since 1998, there would be a rematch of last year's finalists. In this case: the Miami Heat and the San Antonio Spurs met for the second consecutive season.\nThis was the first NBA Finals under commissioner Adam Silver.\nFor the first time since 1984, the NBA Finals were played in a 2–2–1–1–1 format (the higher seed hosts Games 1, 2, 5, and 7, the lower seed hosts Games 3, 4, and 6).\nGame 1: The air conditioning at the AT&T Center broke, resulting in sweltering conditions. LeBron James left the game with cramps.\nGame 2: With the win, the Miami Heat extended their playoff road record to 16 straight playoff series in which they won a road game.\nGame 3: In the first half, the San Antonio Spurs set an NBA record for accuracy (in shots made). The Spurs won this game, and took a 2–1 series lead. The Miami Heat, on the other hand, lost their first home playoff game of the season.\nGame 4: The Miami Heat lost consecutive postseason games for the first time since 2012. The San Antonio Spurs, on the other hand, took a 3–1 series lead.\nGame 5: Overcoming a double digit first quarter deficit, the San Antonio Spurs won the game and the NBA Finals four games to one. This was also the final game of the Miami Heat's big three era.\n\nFormat\nWithin each conference, the three division winners and the five non-division winners with the most wins qualified for the playoffs. The seedings are based on each team's record; however, a division winner is guaranteed to be ranked at least fourth, regardless of record.\nEach conference's bracket is fixed; there is no reseeding. All rounds are best-of-seven series; the team that has four wins advances to the next round. As stated above, all rounds, including the NBA Finals, are in a 2–2–1–1–1 format. Home court advantage in any round does not necessarily belong to the higher-seeded team, but instead to the team with the better regular season record. If two teams with the same record meet in a round, standard tiebreaker rules are used. The rule for determining home court advantage in the NBA Finals is winning percentage, then head-to-head record, followed by record vs. opposite conference.\n\nTiebreak procedures\nThe tiebreakers that determine seedings are:\n\nDivision leader wins tie from team not leading a division\nHead-to-head record\nDivision record (if all the tied teams are in the same division)\nConference record\nRecord vs. playoff teams, own conference\nRecord vs. playoff teams, other conference (only in two-way tie)\nPoint differential, all games\nIf there were more than two teams tied, the team that wins the tiebreaker gets the highest seed, while the other teams were \"re-broken\" from the first step until all ties were resolved. Since the three division winners were guaranteed a spot in the top four, ties to determine the division winners had to be broken before any other ties.\n\nPlayoff qualifying\nEastern Conference\n— = Did not achieve\n\nWestern Conference\n— = Did not achieve\nNotes\n\nBracket\nTeams in bold advanced to the next round. The numbers to the left of each team indicate the team's seeding in its conference, and the numbers to the right indicate the number of games the team won in that round. The division champions are marked by an asterisk. Teams with home court advantage are shown in italics.\n\nFirst round\nAll times are in Eastern Daylight Time (UTC−4)\n\nEastern Conference first round\n(1) Indiana Pacers vs. (8) Atlanta Hawks\nWith the season series between the two tied at 2 games apiece and Indiana's post All-Star break malaise, the series was expected to be closer than the seedings might suggest. In Game 1, the Pacers' struggles continued as the Hawks snatched away home-court advantage and took a 1–0 series lead. In Game 2, the Pacers were in danger of falling 0–2 in the series after the Hawks led by as much as 11 in the first half. However, the Pacers used a big 32–6 run spanning the second and third periods to take a 101–85 win and tie the series at 1 apiece. In Game 3, the Hawks blew the game open in the second half to take a 98–85 win and a surprising 2–1 series lead. In Game 4, the Pacers were once again in danger after the Hawks led by as much as 10 before the Pacers started to rally back. Paul George and David West hit crucial threes in the final quarter to give the Pacers a 91–88 win and tie the series at 2 all. The Hawks still had a chance to force overtime but Pero Antić missed his three-pointer as the Pacers took back home-court advantage.\nIn Game 5, the Hawks embarrassed the Pacers as they used a big second quarter to take a commanding lead of as much as 30 before holding off the Pacers for a 107–97 win and a 3–2 series lead, putting the 1st-seeded Pacers on the brink of elimination. In Game 6, the Hawks looked like they were in position for the upset when they led by 5 with about 3 minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. However, West led the way for the Pacers as they forced a decisive Game 7 with a 95–88 win. The Pacers were able to finish off the Hawks in Game 7 with a 92–80 win to avoid becoming the sixth first-seeded team to lose a series to an eight-seeded team in NBA history.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the sixth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Pacers winning three of the first five meetings.\n\n(2) Miami Heat vs. (7) Charlotte Bobcats\nThe series pitted the two-time defending champions against a franchise only in its second playoff appearance ever (the Bobcats first played in the playoffs in 2010). As a result, the Bobcats were deemed heavy underdogs against the Heat. In Game 1, the Bobcats started strong, leading by as much as 9, but were dealt a big blow when their franchise player, Al Jefferson, suffered a left plantar fascia strain following a misstep in the first quarter. The Heat then rallied after receiving a big boost from seldom-used James Jones, who scored 12 points, allowing them to eventually pull away in the fourth quarter for a 99–88 win in the series opener. In Game 2, the Heat were able to build a 16-point first half lead before the Bobcats started to rally back. The Bobcats had a chance to force overtime, but Dwyane Wade came up with a key steal and a free throw to ice the game and give the Heat a 2–0 lead.\nIn Game 3, the Bobcats started strong once again, led by Jefferson who scored 15 points in the first quarter, but the Heat again rallied behind LeBron James, who led the Heat with 30 points. The Heat led by as much as 26 before holding on for a 98–85 win and a commanding 3–0 series lead. In Game 4, the Bobcats played without Jefferson who was plagued by the injury he suffered in Game 1, leaving Kemba Walker to lead the team. Although he scored 29 points on 11/15 shooting, the Heat were able to complete the sweep with a big third quarter, sending them to the second round, and in the process ending the tenure of the Charlotte Bobcats, who became the Charlotte Hornets starting next season.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Hornets winning the first meeting. Note that historical records of the original Charlotte Hornets franchise (later relocated and renamed the New Orleans Pelicans) from 1988 to 2002 are currently with the present Hornets/Bobcats franchise since the 2014–15 season.\n\n(3) Toronto Raptors vs. (6) Brooklyn Nets\nThe Raptors and the Nets faced off in the playoffs once again after they previously faced each other in 2007, when the Nets prevailed in six games. In Game 1, Paul Pierce led the way for the Nets in the clutch as they stole Game 1, 94–87, and home-court advantage from the Raptors. In Game 2, the Raptors led by as much as 11 in the first half before holding off the Nets in the final quarter to tie the series at 1 all. In Game 3, the Nets led by 15 with about 5 minutes remaining in the final period before the Raptors stormed back. With a chance to force overtime, Raptors forward Patrick Patterson missed two crucial free throws as the Nets held on for a 102–98 win and a 2–1 lead. In Game 4, in a reversal of Game 3, the Raptors were able to build a 17-point lead in the first half before the Nets rallied back to tie the game heading into the final period. However, the Raptors finished the game on a 9–0 run to win the game, 87–79, and tie the series at 2 each.\nIn Game 5, the Raptors dominated the first three quarters to lead by as much as 26 but the Nets stormed back in the final quarter. With a chance to force overtime, Andray Blatche threw an errant pass that resulted in a backcourt violation, giving the Raptors the win and the crucial 3–2 series lead, but not before the play was reviewed because it was thought that the ball might have been tipped back before Deron Williams fired a half-court shot that was goaltended by Jonas Valančiūnas. The Nets then proceeded to blow out the Raptors in Game 6 to force a seventh and decisive game. Game 7 was close up until the final seconds of the game. With the Nets leading by 1, Kyle Lowry had a chance to win the game and the series for the Raptors but Pierce blocked his shot, giving the Nets the win and the series victory.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Nets winning the first meeting.\n\n(4) Chicago Bulls vs. (5) Washington Wizards\nThe Bulls tried to make it through the playoffs for a third straight year without their main superstar, Derrick Rose, who suffered an early season-ending injury. Meanwhile, the Wizards made the playoffs for only the first time since 2008. As such, the series was expected to be evenly matched, although most analysts predicted a Bulls series victory. In Game 1, the Bulls led by as much as 13 in the third quarter before the Wizards soon started their comeback. Led by Nenê's 24 points, the Wizards used a big fourth quarter to rally back for a 102–93 win and to steal home-court advantage away from the Bulls. In Game 2, the Wizards again rallied back from 10 down in regulation to force overtime before hanging on for a 101–99 win to go up 2–0 in the series.\nThe Bulls prevented a commanding 3–0 lead by the Wizards in Game 3 with a 100–97 victory. The Bulls were led by Mike Dunleavy Jr. who scored 35 points including 8 three-pointers. Meanwhile, the Wizards suffered a big blow in Game 4 when Nenê was suspended after he had an altercation with Bulls' guard Jimmy Butler. In Game 4, the Wizards had no problem defeating the Bulls without Nenê, leading from start to finish en route to a 98–89 win to take a commanding 3–1 lead. In Game 5, the Wizards closed out their upset of the Bulls, 75–69, in a low-scoring affair as they won the series 4–1 to advance to the second round for the first time since 2005.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with each team winning one series apiece.\n\nWestern Conference first round\n(1) San Antonio Spurs vs. (8) Dallas Mavericks\nDespite the fact that the Spurs swept the season series against the Mavericks, the series was expected to be close because of the rivalry that the two teams have. In Game 1,  the Spurs suffered a big blow as Tim Duncan limped off the floor in the third quarter. As he watched the Mavs take a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter, he returned in the game to lead the Spurs to a 90–85 victory and a 1–0 series lead. The Mavs proceeded to build another big lead in Game 2 but unlike in Game 1, they never looked back as they blew out the Spurs to tie the series at 1. Game 3 was close until the final minute. With the Mavs down by 2 with 1.7 seconds remaining, Vince Carter hit the game-winning three-pointer with no time left on the clock to give the Mavs a 1-point win and a surprising 2–1 series lead. Game 4 saw the Spurs erect a 20-point lead before the Mavs rallied back. With the Mavs down by 2 once again, Monta Ellis missed a potential game-tying layup as the Spurs tied the series at 2 and regained the home-court advantage.\nThe Mavs were dealt a big blow when DeJuan Blair was suspended for Game 5 after kicking Tiago Splitter in the head. In Game 5, the Spurs led from start to finish to win, 109–103, and to take a crucial 3–2 series lead. However, Ellis and Nowitzki led the Mavs to a series-tying 113–111 win in Game 6 to force a decisive game. The Spurs had a chance to force overtime or to win the series after Ellis threw an errant pass but they were not able to get a shot off in time. In Game 7, Tony Parker scored 32 points as the Spurs blew out the Mavs, 119–96, to win the series, 4–3.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the sixth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Spurs winning three of the first five meetings.\n\n(2) Oklahoma City Thunder vs. (7) Memphis Grizzlies\nIn Game 1, the Thunder held the Grizzlies to a 36 percent field goal shooting and led by as many as 25 before holding on to a 100–86 win and a 1–0 series lead. The next four games of the series all went to overtime, breaking an NBA record for most number of OT games in a series. In Game 2, the Grizzlies led by 5 with 18 seconds remaining when Kevin Durant hit a miraculous 4-point play and after a made free throw by Mike Conley Jr., Kendrick Perkins made a putback at the buzzer to force overtime. However, the Grizzlies held on in OT and tied the series at 1 game apiece. The Grizzlies led by 17 in the fourth quarter before the Thunder came roaring back. The Thunder trailed by 4 in the final minute when Westbrook hit a 4-point play that eventually forced overtime. However, the Grizzlies held off the Thunder for a 2–1 series lead.\nIn Game 4, with Durant and Westbrook struggling offensively, Reggie Jackson scored a career-high 32 points that helped the Thunder take a 14-point lead before the Grizzlies stormed back. With the Grizzlies leading by 5 in the final minute, Jackson hit a 3 and a layup to force overtime. The Grizzlies still had a chance to force a second overtime but Conley's three missed as the Thunder tied the series at 2. Game 5 saw the Grizzlies erect a 20-point lead in the third quarter, but the Thunder rallied back. With the Thunder trailing by 2, Westbrook came up with a steal and a dunk to force another overtime. The Thunder had a chance to win the game in overtime but Durant's three missed. Luckily, Serge Ibaka made a putback but replays showed that the ball left Ibaka's hands after the buzzer sounded, giving the Grizzlies a 3–2 series lead. Knowing that their season could once again end in Grizzlies' hands if they lost another game, the Thunder blew out the Grizzlies in Game 6, forcing a decisive game. Prior to Game 7, Zach Randolph was suspended for punching Steven Adams while jogging back in transition in Game 6. Though putting up a valiant effort without their leading scorer, the Grizzlies ultimately succumbed to the Thunder who managed to avenge their loss from the year before.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with each team winning one series apiece.\n\n(3) Los Angeles Clippers vs. (6) Golden State Warriors\nThe series was seen as one of the most dramatic first round series in the NBA, especially after the controversy surrounding Clippers' owner Donald Sterling's racist comments arose. In Game 1, with the Warriors up by 3 in the final seconds, the Clippers had a chance to force overtime but Darren Collison stepped out of bounds after running down the loose ball. Klay Thompson sealed a 1–0 series lead for the Warriors by splitting his free throws as the Warriors took away home court advantage. The Clippers tied the series at 1 after blowing out the Warriors in Game 2 by 40 to set a franchise record for the largest margin of victory in a postseason game. In Game 3, the Warriors rallied back from an 18-point deficit in the third quarter. Down by 2, the Warriors had a chance to win but Stephen Curry's three missed as the Clippers took back home court advantage and a 2–1 lead in the series.\nA day after the Clippers' Game 3 win, controversy regarding Clippers' owner Donald Sterling's racist comments arose. As a result, the Clippers silently protested in Game 4 by shedding their warm-up jerseys and going through the pregame routine with their red shirts on inside out. However, Curry scored 33 points including seven three-pointers as the Warriors blew out the Clippers to tie the series at 2. Before Game 5, the NBA handed out a lifetime suspension to Donald Sterling. This appeared to have a positive effect on the Clippers, who won a hotly contested Game 5 in front of their home crowd to lead the series, 3–2. DeAndre Jordan led the Clippers in the game with 25 points, 18 rebounds and 4 blocks to become the first player since Tim Duncan in 2008 to have such stats in a playoff game.\nThe Warriors were able to stave off elimination with a 100–99 win in Game 6 to force a decisive game. The Clippers had many chances to chip into the Warriors' 4-point lead in the final minute, but they missed their chances and Matt Barnes' three-pointer was already too late. In Game 7, the Warriors controlled the first quarter, but the Clippers eventually came back. In the final quarter, it was the Clippers who hit the biggest shots as they took Game 7 to advance to the semifinals.\n\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Warriors and the Clippers.\n\n(4) Houston Rockets vs. (5) Portland Trail Blazers\nThe two teams faced off in the playoffs for the fourth time and the Blazers tried to defeat the Rockets after losing their previous three encounters. In Game 1, the Rockets held an 11-point lead with 4:30 remaining in the fourth quarter but the Blazers rallied to force overtime. It again appeared the Rockets had too large of a lead to overcome when they led by 6 in overtime but LaMarcus Aldridge hit a desperation three to spark an 8–0 run. The Rockets had a chance to win but James Harden missed a three-pointer as they took away home court advantage and a 1–0 series lead. Aldridge scored a career-high 46 points to lead the Blazers. In Game 2, the Rockets had no answers for Aldridge once again as he scored 43 points to give the Blazers a 112–105 win and a 2–0 series lead heading to the next two games in Portland. In Game 3, Nicolas Batum was able to force overtime with a 3 with 41 seconds remaining in regulation. In overtime, with the two teams tied at 116, seldom-used Troy Daniels hit a crucial 3-pointer. The Blazers had a chance to force overtime but Batum missed his three-pointer and Harden made two free throws to clinch the game. In Game 4, the two teams went to overtime again after Dwight Howard hit a dunk with 3 seconds remaining in regulation before Mo Williams missed a 3 at the buzzer. However, the Blazers had a 9–2 run in overtime to clinch a 3–1 series lead for the Blazers. The Rockets had a chance to tie the game but Wesley Matthews stole the ball.\nFacing elimination in Game 5, the Rockets held Aldridge to 8 points as they lived to fight another day with a 108–98 win to trim the Blazers' series lead to 3–2. Game 6 was close in the final minute. It seemed that a Game 7 was inevitable when Chandler Parsons hit a reverse layup with 0:9 seconds remaining but the Rockets' hearts were broken when Damian Lillard hit a game-winning three-point shot at the horn to send Portland to the second round of the playoffs. The most recent person to hit a series-winning buzzer beater prior to Lillard was John Stockton, who hit the game-winning three-point shot against Houston in 1997 to advance to the Finals. With their win, Portland advanced to the second-round appearance for the first time since 2000, ending a 14-year drought which was the longest at the time.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Rockets winning the first three meetings.\n\nConference semifinals\nEastern Conference semifinals\n(1) Indiana Pacers vs. (5) Washington Wizards\nGoing to the Conference Semifinals, the Pacers came off a tough seven-game series against the Hawks while the Wizards were able to dispatch the Bulls in five games, giving them plenty of time to rest and prepare for the second round. In Game 1, the Wizards held a 13-point lead after one quarter and kept that momentum to take the series opener and the home court advantage away from the Pacers. Trevor Ariza led the Wizards' charge with 22 points including 6/6 from three-point land. After being criticized once again for having a 0-point and 0-rebound performance in Game 1, Roy Hibbert broke loose for 28 points as he led the Pacers to a series-tying 86–82 victory over the Wizards. In Game 3, the Pacers' early season form returned, holding the Wizards to only 63 points and 33 percent shooting as they blew them out to take a 2–1 series lead.\nIt looked as if the Wizards had Game 4 in hand when they led by 19 points early in the third quarter but the Pacers eventually came back. Trailing by 3 with 6 seconds remaining, the Wizards had a chance to force overtime but Ariza threw an errant pass, sealing the win and the 3–1 series lead for the Pacers. Paul George led the Pacers' comeback with 39 points including 28 in the second half. In Game 5, the Wizards responded by blowing out the Pacers, 102–79, with Marcin Gortat scoring 31 points and grabbing 16 rebounds. The Wizards held a 62–23 rebounding advantage in Game 5, the widest margin in a playoff game since 1985. However, David West led the Pacers with 29 points in Game 6 as the Pacers ended the Wizards' run with a 93–80 win as they advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals for the second straight year.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Pacers and the Wizards.\n\n(2) Miami Heat vs. (6) Brooklyn Nets\nDespite the fact that the Nets swept the season series against the Heat, the series was expected to be close, with all their four regular season meetings going down to the wire. In Game 1, the Heat showed no signs of rust from their long rest, blowing out the Nets, 107–86, for their first victory against the Nets all season long and the 1–0 series lead. In Game 2, the game was close until the Heat pulled away in the fourth quarter, outscoring the Nets by 10 en route to a 94–82 win and the 2–0 series lead as they remained perfect in the postseason. The game was clinched when the Heat held the ball from the 3:39 mark to the 1:59 mark of the final quarter, grabbing three offensive rebounds until LeBron James made a layup to make it a 10-point game, essentially icing the game. Mirza Teletović had a breakout playoff game with 20 points including 6 three-pointers for the Nets in a losing effort. In Game 3, the Nets had a hot shooting performance from three-point range, hitting 15 three-pointers as the Nets defeated the Heat, 104–90, to deal the Heat their first loss of the postseason and to cut their series deficit to 2–1.\nGame 4 was close throughout, but the Heat were victorious, 102–96, to take a commanding 3–1 series lead. James exploded for a Heat playoff franchise record 49 points on an efficient 16/24 shooting clip and Chris Bosh made a tie breaking three-pointer in the final minute to give the Heat the lead for good before Ray Allen and James clinched the game with 5 free throws. In Game 5, a series extension seemed likely when the Nets led by 8 points with 5 minutes remaining. However, they went scoreless for the next 4+1⁄2 minutes, allowing the Heat to make a 12–0 run capped by a three-pointer and two free throws by Allen to take the lead for good. The Nets had a chance to tie after a Joe Johnson three-pointer and a split from the free throw line by James but Johnson wasn't able to get a shot off, giving the Heat the win as they advanced to their fourth straight Eastern Conference Finals appearance.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Heat winning the first two meetings.\n\nWestern Conference semifinals\n(1) San Antonio Spurs vs. (5) Portland Trail Blazers\nThe Spurs and the Blazers were coming off two tough first round series. The Spurs came off a tough seven-game series against the Mavericks while Blazers came off a dramatic first round series against the Rockets where Damian Lillard finished off the Rockets with a buzzer-beating three-pointer. In Game 1, the Spurs' experience paid off against the young Blazers, blowing them out in Game 1 to take the series opener. Tony Parker led the Spurs with 33 points in Game 1. Game 2 was more of the same, with the Spurs pulling away in the second quarter to blow out the Blazers once again as they took a 2–0 lead. They were able to hold the duo of LaMarcus Aldridge and Lillard to a combined 14/43 shooting. With the series shifting to Portland, the Blazers tried to close in on the Spurs' series lead but they were blown out for the third consecutive time as they fell behind 0–3 in the series. No NBA team has ever came back to win a series after being down 0–3.\nIn Game 4, the Blazers finally won against the Spurs in the series, outscoring the Spurs 35–20 in the third quarter en route to a 103–92 win to cut their series deficit to 3–1. However, the Spurs were able to finish off the Blazers in Game 5 with another blowout win, sending them to the Western Conference Finals for the third consecutive year.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Spurs winning two of the first three meetings.\n\n(2) Oklahoma City Thunder vs. (3) Los Angeles Clippers\nThe Thunder and the Clippers were both coming off tough seven-game series against the Grizzlies and Warriors, respectively. The series was expected to be close with the two teams tied in their regular season series. In Game 1, the Clippers easily took home court advantage away from the Thunder, blowing them out, 122–105, and taking a 1–0 series lead. Chris Paul led the Clippers with 32 points including a career-high eight three-pointers. Game 2 was different, with Paul held to just two three-pointers as the Thunder took Game 2 to tie the series at 1. Russell Westbrook had a triple-double with 31 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists. In Game 3, Serge Ibaka gave a big boost to the Thunder with 20 points as the Thunder took back home court advantage with a 118–112 victory to take a 2–1 series lead. Game 4 saw the Thunder build a big 22-point lead before the Clippers closed in on the Thunder. Darren Collison gave the Clippers the lead for good by hitting a layup with a minute remaining. The Thunder had a chance to win, but Westbrook's three-point shot missed as the Clippers tied the series at 2.\nIn Game 5, the Clippers built an early 15-point lead, but the Thunder came back. The Clippers still led by 13 with 4 minutes remaining, but the Thunder relentlessly closed in. It seemed like the Clippers had the game in hand when they led by 7 points with 49 seconds remaining, but the Thunder closed the game on an 8–0 run, courtesy of a three-pointer and layup by Kevin Durant and three free throws by Westbrook. The Clippers had a chance to win, but Paul committed a turnover, sealing the 3–2 lead for the Thunder. Game 5 also ended in controversy after a questionable out-of-bounds call with 11 seconds remaining. The referees ruled that the ball went off the Clippers' Matt Barnes, giving the Thunder possession with 11.3 seconds to play and setting up Westbrook's game-winning free throws. Although replays showed that the ball went off Oklahoma City's Reggie Jackson, the officials awarded the ball to the Thunder. After review, the play stood. In Game 6, the Clippers built another double-digit lead, but the Thunder eventually came back as they took the series in 6 games. Durant had 39 points for the Thunder, who advanced to the Western Conference Finals for the third time in four years.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Clippers and the Thunder.\n\nConference finals\nEastern Conference finals\n(1) Indiana Pacers vs. (2) Miami Heat\nThe series marked the third consecutive year that the Heat and the Pacers faced off in the playoffs including the second consecutive time in the Conference Finals. The Heat won the previous two match ups against the Pacers and the Pacers tried to dethrone them as Eastern Conference Champions. In Game 1, the Pacers finally started a series on the right foot by defeating the Heat, 107–96, as they took the series opener. The Pacers jumped to a 10-point lead early and they never looked back, leading by as much as 19. However, the Heat responded by taking Game 2, 87–83, and the home court advantage. LeBron James and Dwyane Wade led the Heat in the clutch, scoring the Heat's last 20 points. Lance Stephenson led the Pacers with 25 points but he was held to one field goal in the fourth quarter. The Heat won Game 3, 99–87, to take a 2–1 series lead. The Pacers started strong, leading by as much as 15 in the second quarter before the Heat cut the lead to 4 by halftime. The Heat eventually pulled away in the fourth quarter with the help of Ray Allen's 16 points including four key three-pointers in the final period. In Game 4, after scoring just a total of 27 points in the first three games, Chris Bosh finally broke out of his slump by scoring 25 points, almost matching his total from the first three games. James led the Heat with 32 points to give the Heat a wire-to-wire 102–90 victory that put them one game away from the NBA Finals.\nIn Game 5, it seemed like the Heat's 11-point lead in the third quarter was too much to overcome. However, James received his fourth and fifth fouls early in the third quarter, putting him on the bench and giving the Pacers momentum to come back and take Game 5, 93–90, to stave off elimination. Paul George led the Pacers with 37 points, including 21 in the fourth quarter alone. The Heat had a chance to win but Bosh missed a three-pointer. James also produced his worst playoff game, scoring just 7 points after being plagued by foul trouble. However, the Heat did not let the series go to a Game 7 as they blew out the Pacers in Game 6, 117–92, finishing them off for the third straight year as they advanced to their fourth straight NBA Finals appearance.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Heat winning two of the first three meetings.\n\nWestern Conference finals\n(1) San Antonio Spurs vs. (2) Oklahoma City Thunder\nThe series featured a rematch of the 2012 Western Conference Finals that was won by the Thunder in six games after they trailed 0–2 in the series. The series was expected to be close, but the Thunder suffered a big blow when Serge Ibaka was ruled out of the rest of the playoffs. The Spurs took advantage of the absence of Ibaka as they blew out the Thunder in Game 1. The Spurs were able to outscore the Thunder, 66–32, in the paint. Game 2 saw the Spurs blow out the Thunder by 35 points, with the Spurs holding Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook to 15 points each. Danny Green hit seven three-pointers in the game. Before Game 3, fortunes turned around for the Thunder when Ibaka was upgraded to \"day-to-day,\" allowing for the possibility that he could play in the series. Ibaka returned in Game 3 as a member of the starting lineup, and his presence motivated the Thunder to win Game 3, cutting their series deficit to 2–1. The Thunder proceeded to blow out the Spurs in Game 4, tying the series at 2 games apiece. Westbrook led the Thunder with 40 points and Durant added 31 points.\nIn Game 5, the Spurs didn't let a repeat of the 2012 Western Conference Finals happen as they blew out the Thunder once again to take a 3–2 series lead, sending them a win away from a return trip to the NBA Finals. Game 6 was the first close game in the series. Before the fourth quarter began, Tony Parker suffered a minor injury, and sat out the rest of the game, so Patty Mills played most of the fourth quarter and the overtime.  The Spurs held a 6-point lead with around 2+1⁄2 minutes remaining, but the Thunder answered with an 8–0 run.  However, Manu Ginóbili hit a three-pointer and a split from the free throw line to give the Spurs a 2-point lead before Westbrook sent the game to overtime with two free throws. In overtime, it was Tim Duncan who helped the Spurs pull away as they won the series, 4–2, to advance to the NBA Finals for a second straight year.\n\nRegular-season series\n\nThis was the fifth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Spurs winning three of the first four meetings.\n\nNBA Finals: (E2) Miami Heat vs. (W1) San Antonio Spurs\nGame 5 is Ray Allen's final NBA game.\nRegular-season series\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs had met the Miami Heat the previous year in the Finals, and on the brink of winning the championship title with seconds left, the Spurs blew a 5-point lead with 28 seconds left in Game 6. Thus, it was quite clear that the Spurs wanted redemption. \nIn Game 1, it was quite tight for the first three quarters, but mid-way in the 4th quarter, LeBron James suffered a cramp injury, forcing him to leave the game with 25 points. The Spurs then went on an 18–2 run with James not on the court and comfortably won 110–95 and take a 1–0 lead. Game 2 was quite similar, being very close for almost all of the game, despite LeBron's 14 points in the 3rd quarter on 6 straight jump shots and 35 points for the game. In the 4th quarter, Chris Bosh made several clutch plays, including a 3-pointer, and setting up Dwyane Wade to put up Miami by 5 with less than 10 seconds left. Miami tied the series, winning 98–96. \nIn Game 3, Miami looked to take the lead in the series, having not lost at home in eight games for the entire postseason. However, it was all San Antonio, scoring 41 points in the first quarter and 71 points at the half on 76% shooting, an NBA Finals record. The Heat, down 21 points at the half and down as much 25 throughout the game, cut the lead to 7, but never come closer. Big performances from Kawhi Leonard (career-high 29 points on 10–13 shooting) and Danny Green (15 points on 7–8 shooting & 5 steals in 21 minutes) helped ease the Spurs to a 111–92 blowout, taking a 2–1 series lead and handing Miami their first home loss of the playoffs. Game 4 was strikingly similar, with San Antonio dominating the first half 55–36, and never looking back. Another good performance by Kawhi Leonard (20 points, 14 rebounds, 3 assists, 3 blocks, 3 steals), Tony Parker (19 points) and Patty Mills (14 points in 16 minutes) helped the Spurs to a 107–86 blowout and take a commanding 3–1 lead in the series. This was also the first time Miami had lost 2 consecutive playoff games since 2012. Tim Duncan also made history, having played the most minutes in NBA playoff history while also passing Magic Johnson for the most double-doubles in the playoffs with 158. \nIn Game 5, Miami got off to a fast start, once leading 22–6, while LeBron James having a 17-point and 6-rebound first quarter. However, San Antonio outscored Miami by 14 in the second quarter, sneaking their way back into the game. In the third quarter, the Spurs outscored Miami 30–18, with Patty Mills scoring 14 points in the quarter with 4 3-point shots, and from there on it was a blowout. Despite a 31–10–5 performance from LeBron James, poor performances came from Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade and Ray Allen (combining for 11–34 shooting). Kawhi Leonard shot 70% from the field and 75% from 3-point land and score 22 points while also going along with 10 rebounds, Ginobili and Mills shot a combined 8–14 from 3-point territory, and the Spurs shot 46% from 3-point land, and the San Antonio Spurs blew out the Heat again 104–87 to win their fifth title in franchise history and avenge the previous year's heartbreaking loss.\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Heat winning the first meeting.\n\nStatistical leaders\nMedia coverage\nTelevision\nIn the United States, ESPN, ESPN2, ABC, TNT, and NBA TV  broadcast the 2014 NBA Playoffs nationally in its entirety.

    "2015 NBA playoffs": "The 2015 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 2014–15 season. The tournament concluded with the Western Conference champion Golden State Warriors defeating the Eastern Conference champion Cleveland Cavaliers 4 games to 2 in the NBA Finals. Andre Iguodala was named NBA Finals MVP.\n\nOverview\nWestern Conference\nFor the first time since 2005–06, all teams from a particular division made the playoffs (in this case, all five teams from the Southwest Division).\n\nThe San Antonio Spurs made their 18th straight playoff appearance, while the Golden State Warriors (third straight playoff appearance) entered the playoffs as the first seed of their respective conferences.\nDespite making the Western Conference Finals the previous year and winning 45 games this season, the Oklahoma City Thunder missed the playoffs due to a tie-breaker with the New Orleans Pelicans. The Pelicans themselves made their first playoff appearance since 2011, and their first as The Pelicans.\n\nEastern Conference\nThe Atlanta Hawks entered their eighth consecutive postseason (continuing the longest active streak in the Eastern Conference) with the top seed in the Eastern Conference.\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers made their first postseason appearance since 2010, the final season of LeBron James' first stint with the Cavaliers. On the other hand, James' former team, the Miami Heat, missed the playoffs after making the previous year's Finals, becoming the first team to do so since the 2005 Lakers. Miami had qualified for the playoffs for six consecutive seasons before missing this year, also reaching the NBA Finals four consecutive times. The Heat and their fellow Floridian team, the Orlando Magic, both missed the playoffs in the same season for the first time since 1993.\nDespite making the Eastern Conference Finals last season, the Indiana Pacers failed to make the playoffs by virtue of losing a tie-breaker to the Brooklyn Nets.\nDespite starting their respective seasons in a rebuilding mode, both the Milwaukee Bucks and the Boston Celtics returned to the playoffs after a one-year absence. Bucks head coach Jason Kidd became the first head coach to lead two teams to the playoffs in his first two seasons, having led the Nets to the playoffs the previous season.\n\nFirst Round\nThe first round of the playoffs saw a record six teams take a 3–0 lead in their respective series, the first time it had happened since the first round expanded to a best-of-seven series in 2003.\nThe fifth seed defeated the fourth seed in both conferences for the third straight year.\nWith their first round victory over the Dallas Mavericks, the Houston Rockets won their first playoff series since 2009.\nGame 7 between the Clippers and Spurs ensured a 16th straight postseason in which at least one Game 7 was played; 1999 was the last postseason to not feature a Game 7.\nThe San Antonio Spurs became the first defending champions to be eliminated in the first round since the 2011–12 Dallas Mavericks. This was only the second time it had happened since 2000.\n\nConference Semifinals\nWith the Spurs being eliminated in the first round, none of the eight teams remaining at the beginning of the Conference Semifinals had previously won an NBA championship in the 21st century. Entering the Conference Semifinals, of the teams who had previously won an NBA championship, the Chicago Bulls had the shortest drought at 17 years, having most recently won an NBA championship in 1998, while the Atlanta Hawks had the longest overall drought at 57 years, having won their only previous championship in 1958 when the franchise was based in St. Louis.\nAll teams that held a 2–1 series lead within the first three games of their respective second round series had gone on to lose that series.\nThe Cavaliers–Bulls series was notable for two game winning baskets by both teams’ star players.\n\nGame 3: Derrick Rose hitting a wide open three pointer to win the game for the Chicago Bulls.\nGame 4: LeBron James making a catch and shoot two pointer to win the game for the Cleveland Cavaliers.\nWith their Game 7 win over the Los Angeles Clippers, the Houston Rockets became the ninth team in NBA history to come back from 3–1 series deficits to win the conference semifinals, and only the second franchise to do it twice. They had first achieved that goal 20 years ago against the Phoenix Suns. The Boston Celtics are the only other franchise to twice make this comeback, doing it in 1968 and 1981. Overall, twelve teams have achieved the feat, with the Golden State Warriors doing it in the Western Conference Finals and Cleveland Cavaliers doing it in the NBA Finals the following season. The Denver Nuggets did it twice in 2020.\nWith their series win over the Chicago Bulls, the Cleveland Cavaliers made the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 2009.\nWith their series win over the Washington Wizards, the Atlanta Hawks made the Conference Finals (then called the Division Finals) for the first time since 1970. Since 1970, they had lost all 15 Division or Conference Semifinal series they participated in.\nWith their series win over the Memphis Grizzlies, the Golden State Warriors made their first conference finals appearance since 1976, while the Houston Rockets made their first conference finals appearance since 1997. The Hawks, Warriors, and Rockets were the three NBA teams which had been waiting for the longest time for a return to the conference finals prior to this postseason.\n\nConference Finals\nFor the second straight year, the No. 1 seed faced the No. 2 seed in the Conference Finals, and for the fourth time since 2000.\nFor the first time in NBA playoff history, both conference finals teams, the Warriors of the West and the Cavaliers of the East, held commanding 3–0 series leads. Cleveland went on to the finals, sweeping the Atlanta Hawks 4–0 to make their first NBA Finals since 2007, while Golden State won their series 4–1 defeating the Houston Rockets en route to their first NBA Finals since 1975.\n\nNBA Finals\nFor the first time since the inaugural Basketball Association of America season in 1946–47, two rookie coaches, David Blatt of the Cavaliers and Steve Kerr of the Warriors, met each other in the NBA finals.\nLike the Conference Semifinals, the team that took a 2–1 series lead (the Cleveland Cavaliers), went on to lose the series.\nThe Golden State Warriors won their first championship since 1975. Andre Iguodala was named NBA Finals MVP despite not starting in a game until the NBA Finals.\n\nFormat\nWithin each conference, the three division winners and the five non-division winners with the most wins qualified for the playoffs. The seedings are based on each team's record; however, a division winner is guaranteed to be ranked at least fourth, regardless of record.\nEach conference's bracket is fixed; there is no reseeding. All rounds are best-of-seven series; the team that has four wins advances to the next round. As stated above, all rounds, including the NBA Finals, are in a 2–2–1–1–1 format. Home court advantage in any round does not necessarily belong to the higher-seeded team, but instead to the team with the better regular season record. If two teams with the same record meet in a round, standard tiebreaker rules are used. The rule for determining home court advantage in the NBA Finals is winning percentage, then head-to-head record, followed by record vs. opposite conference.\n\nTiebreaker rules\nThe tiebreakers that determine seedings are:\n\nDivision leader wins tie from team not leading a division\nHead-to-head record\nDivision record (if all the tied teams are in the same division)\nConference record\nRecord vs. playoff teams, own conference\nRecord vs. playoff teams, other conference (only in two-way tie)\nPoint differential, all games\nIf there are more than two teams tied, the team that wins the tiebreaker gets the highest seed, while the other teams were \"re-broken\" from the first step until all ties were resolved. Since the three division winners were guaranteed a spot in the top four, ties to determine the division winners had to be broken before any other ties.\n\nPossible future changes\nAs the 2014–15 regular season proceeded into February 2015, the ninth-place team in the Western Conference had a better record than the eighth-place team in the East. This led NBA Commissioner Adam Silver to suggest changing the playoff format, where the top 16 teams throughout the entire league would qualify, regardless of division or conference. Silver then stated that the league might not be able to implement such changes until the 2016–17 season at the earliest.\n\nPlayoff qualifying\nOn March 3, the Atlanta Hawks became the first team to clinch a playoff spot. This was the earliest a team had clinched a playoff spot since the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls clinched on March 2. The Golden State Warriors became the first Western Conference team to clinch a playoff spot on March 16.\n\nBracket\nNotes\nMemphis had home court advantage in the first round despite not being a higher seed as they had a better regular season record than their opponent, but did not have the best record of the non-division-champion playoff teams in the West. This rule was changed as a result of this season's playoffs. The southwest division, which the Grizzlies are a part of, also had all five teams make the playoffs this year. This had only happened 3 times before.\n\nFirst round\nAll times are in Eastern Daylight Time (UTC−4)\n\nEastern Conference first round\n(1) Atlanta Hawks vs. (8) Brooklyn Nets\nThis was the first meeting in the playoffs between the Hawks and Nets.\n\n(2) Cleveland Cavaliers vs. (7) Boston Celtics\n(3) Chicago Bulls vs. (6) Milwaukee Bucks\nDuring the final minute of the game, Derrick Rose drove inside then passed to Pau Gasol who laid it in as he was fouled. Gasol would then make the free throw and tie the game at 90. Then, when Rose tried to win the series for Chicago, he crossed but then was stripped by Khris Middleton. He then attempted a half court shot, which was blocked by Jimmy Butler when timeout was called. With 1.3 seconds left, Jared Dudley found the lead pass for Jerryd Bayless, due to a defensive breakdown by Rose, who then hit the game-winning lay-up at the buzzer, allowing the Bucks to stave off elimination for at least one more game.\n\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Bucks winning two out of the first three meeting.\n\n(4) Toronto Raptors vs. (5) Washington Wizards\nThis was the first meeting in the playoffs between the Raptors and Wizards.\n\nWestern Conference first round\n(1) Golden State Warriors vs. (8) New Orleans Pelicans\nAfter Anthony Davis split a pair of free throws, Curry missed an attempted game-tying three, but Marreese Speights grabbed the offensive rebound and Curry hit another three to tie the game at 108. The Warriors would win in OT.\n\nThis was the first meeting in the playoffs between the Warriors and Pelicans.\n\n(2) Houston Rockets vs. (7) Dallas Mavericks\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Mavericks winning both previous meetings.\n\n(3) Los Angeles Clippers vs. (6) San Antonio Spurs\nIn Game 1, the Clippers had a dominant game. It was close in the first half, but the Clippers pulled away in the second half. Chris Paul scored 32 points, while Blake Griffin scored 27 points. This helped the Clippers win 107–92.\nGame 2 was much closer, requiring overtime. The Spurs won 111–107 in the Staples Center, tying the series 1–1, led by Tim Duncan's 27 points.\nIn Game 3, the Spurs completely controlled the offense, and never trailed. They won 100–73 with Kawhi Leonard scoring 32 points. In Game 4, the Clippers won 114–105. Chris Paul scored 34 points and 7 assists.\nIt was a tight game in Game 5 in the Staples Center, especially in the 4th quarter. At the end of the game, DeAndre Jordan tipped the ball in; however, the refs called goaltending. The Spurs prevailed 111–107, led by Tim Duncan's 24 points and 11 rebounds.\nIn Game 6, Spurs Tim Duncan, Manu Ginóbili, Tony Parker, Kawhi Leonard along with Clippers Chris Paul and Blake Griffin struggled offensively. The Spurs gave up a 10-point lead, allowing the Clippers to win 102–96.\nGame 7 was a very tight game, featuring 31 lead changes and 19 ties. In the first half, Chris Paul injured his hamstring, but returned in the third quarter, concluding that quarter with a buzzer beater 3-pointer, giving them a 79–78 lead. The fourth quarter was a nail-biter, with the Spurs leading in the beginning and the Clippers at the end. With 1 second left in the game, Chris Paul hit the game winner, and the Clippers moved on to the second round by a meager two-point margin. The final score was 111–109.\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Spurs winning the only meeting.\n\n(4) Portland Trail Blazers vs. (5) Memphis Grizzlies\nThis was the first meeting in the playoffs between the Blazers and Grizzlies.\n\nConference semifinals\nEastern Conference semifinals\n(1) Atlanta Hawks vs. (5) Washington Wizards\nThe Hawks rallied from a 19-point deficit heading into the final period to tie the score at 101 with a basket. On the ensuing possession, Paul Pierce, who was double-teamed, hit a fadeaway jumper off the backboard at the buzzer to give the Wizards a 103–101 victory and a 2–1 lead in the series. After the game, when ESPN analyst Chris Broussard asked Pierce if he called bank on that shot, he responded, \"I called game!\"\n\nWith 8.3 seconds left, Kyle Korver inbounded the ball to Dennis Schroder, who drives for the layup that was blocked by John Wall, then Al Horford gets the offensive rebound and hits the game-winning layup with 1.9 seconds left. John Wall then misses the half-court buzzer beater, and the Hawks take the 3–2 series lead.\n\nThe Hawks were up by 3, with 6.4 seconds to go. Bradley Beal's inbound pass went to John Wall, who tried to get open with time running down, then he passed to Paul Pierce who hit an off-balanced game-tying 3. But when officials reviewed the play, the clock reached 0:00 before Pierce released the ball and therefore the shot did not count. The Hawks won the series and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 1970.\n\nThis was the fifth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Wizards (formerly known as the Bullets) winning three out of the first four meetings.\n\n(2) Cleveland Cavaliers vs. (3) Chicago Bulls\nThe Bulls led wire to wire to go up 1–0 in the series, leading by as many as 16 points in the second quarter. The Cavs rallied to tie the game early in the third quarter. However, the Bulls went on a 15–0 run in the third quarter to regain control before holding off the Cavs late in the 4th quarter. \n\nFacing the possibility of going down 2–0 heading to Chicago, the Cavaliers blew out the Bulls in Game 2, leading wire to wire as they evened the series 1–1. The Cavs outscored the Bulls by 20 points in the first quarter and never looked back. The Bulls got no closer than 11 for the rest of the game. LeBron led the Cavs with 33 points on 13/29 shooting while Irving chipped in 21 points. \n\nJ.R. Smith returned to the lineup after missing the first two games due to suspension. This was a very competitive game that saw neither team lead by more than 8 points. Trailing 94–93, LeBron James missed a go-ahead layup with under 24 seconds to play. Taj Gibson was fouled and made two free throws to make it 96–93 Bulls. James found Smith, who hit the game tying three to make it 96–96. The Bulls called timeout on their final possession of regulation. Rose shot a deep three that went off the backboard and into the basket, giving the Bulls a 99–96 win and a 2–1 series lead. Rose led the Bulls with 30 points. LeBron led the Cavs with 27, but he continued to struggle with his shot and Jimmy Butler's defense, going 8/25 for the game and 1/7 on threes.\n\nLooking to go up 3–1 and take complete control of the series, the Bulls went up 37–29 early in the second quarter. However, the Cavs scored 16 unanswered points to go up 45–37 before settling for a 49–45 halftime lead. The Bulls dominated the third quarter, outscoring the Cavs 23–12. They led by as many as 11 points before settling for a 68–61 lead heading into the 4th quarter. Led by J.R. Smith and Timofey Mozgov, the Cavs would rally, opening the 4th quarter on a 19–5 run to take an 80–73 lead with just under 5 minutes to play. With just under 40 seconds to play, LeBron hit two consecutive free throws to put the Cavs up 84–79. Butler hit a three on the Bulls' next possession, cutting the deficit to 84–82. The Cavs were forced to burn three consecutive timeouts as they were unable to inbound the ball. Once they inbounded the ball, James tried to burn the clock down as he was double teamed by Rose and Dunleavy. However, James swung his arm at Dunleavy and committed an offensive foul, giving the ball back to the Bulls with 14 seconds remaining. Rose tied the game with a layup to even the game at 84–84 with 8 seconds remaining. James rushed down the court and tried to score the go-ahead layup but was blocked. The ball went out of bounds with 1.5 seconds remaining. On the Cavs' final possession, Matthew Dellavedova inbounded the ball to James. James fired a jumper over Butler that went through the hoop as the buzzer sounded, giving the Cavs an 86–84 win. The Cavs regained homecourt advantage as they evened up the series at 2–2. James led the team with 25 points (10/30 shooting) while Rose led the Bulls with 31 points on 11/23 shooting. \nThis game was particularly controversial due to a timeout that wasn't called late in the game. After Rose made the layup to tie the game at 84–84, Cavaliers head coach, David Blatt, attempted to call timeout. However, the Cavs were out of timeouts. Calling a timeout without having one would have resulted in a technical foul and possession of the ball would go to the Bulls. Tyron Lue held back Blatt and prevented him from getting that timeout. None of the officials noticed Blatt signaling timeout as James ran up the court for what would eventually lead to his game winning buzzer beater.\nFollowing the game, the NBA officiating report revealed that Blatt should have been charged with a timeout that would have drawn a technical and Cavs turnover.\n\nThe Bulls scored the first 8 points of the contest and led 18–8 early in the first quarter. However, the Cavs closed the first quarter on a 17–6 run to take a 25–24 lead into the 2nd quarter. The Cavs' momentum carried over into the 2nd quarter as they built a 54–44 halftime lead. James, who had struggled mightily with his shooting throughout the series, scored 24 points on 10/12 shooting in the first half. The Cavaliers controlled the third quarter and led by 9 after three quarters. Early in the 4th quarter, Dellavedova fell down, and Gibson's legs got tangled up with his. Gibson, attempting to break free, kicked Dellavedova. Gibson was charged with a flagrant 2 and ejected. The Cavs went up by as many as 17 points in the 4th quarter and led 97–82 with just over 6 minutes to play. However, the Bulls would rally, going on a 17–4 run to make it 101–99 Cavs with just over one minute to play. Trailing by 2, Butler attempted a three that would have given the Bulls to lead. However, he missed. James ran the clock down and missed a shot on the Cavs' next possession. However, Shumpert grabbed the offensive rebound. With 20 seconds remaining, and trailing by 2, the Bulls were forced to foul. However, the Cavs made their free throws and closed the game out, winning 106–101 and taking a 3–2 series lead. James led the Cavaliers with 38 points and 12 rebounds to go along with 6 assists and 0 turnovers. Butler led the Bulls with 29 points. Rose scored 12 points in the first quarter on 5/9 shooting. He had only 5 points on 2/15 shooting in the final three quarters, including 0 made baskets in the second half. \n\nAfter three consecutive contests came down to the final minute, the Cavaliers finally finished off the Bulls, eliminating them 94–73 at the United Center to win the series 4–2. The Bulls led 40–38 halfway through the second quarter. However, the Cavs closed the half on a 20–4 run, leading by 14 at halftime. The Cavs never relinquished control, leading by double digits for the entire second half and going up by as many as 27 points in the 4th quarter. Irving was forced out of the game after suffering an injury in the second quarter. However, Dellavedova led the way, scoring a playoff career high and season high 19 points to lead the Cavaliers. James had 15–9–11, one rebound shy of a triple double. Butler led the Bulls with 20 points. The Bulls scored 31 points in the 1st quarter. However, they were held to 42 points in the final three quarters, including 29 in the second half.\nIt was the 4th time in the last 6 seasons that the Bulls were eliminated by a team with LeBron James on its roster.\n\nThis was the seventh playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Bulls winning five out of the first six meetings.\n\nWestern Conference semifinals\n(1) Golden State Warriors vs. (5) Memphis Grizzlies\nThis was the first meeting in the playoffs between the Warriors and Grizzlies.\n\n(2) Houston Rockets vs. (3) Los Angeles Clippers\nThe Rockets recovered from a 3–1 deficit for the first time since 1995. Game 6 was one for the books as the Rockets overcome a 19–point deficit, going on an incredible 49–18 run including a 40–15 run in the 4th quarter to end the game. The Clippers missed 14 straight shots as Josh Smith and Corey Brewer dominated much of the 4th quarter combining for 29 points. The 4th quarter spark led Houston to a decisive Game 7, and they completed one of the greatest comebacks in NBA playoff history.  This was the ninth time in NBA history a team has come back from a 3–1 deficit to win a series.\nThe Clippers would ultimately suffer the same fate in 2020, in which they relinquished a 19-point lead in Game 6, and eventually blew a 3–1 series lead to the lower-seeded Denver Nuggets.\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Rockets winning the only previous meeting.\n\nConference finals\nEastern Conference finals\n(1) Atlanta Hawks vs. (2) Cleveland Cavaliers\nThe Cavaliers defeated the Hawks 97–89, stealing homecourt advantage and taking a 1–0 series lead. LeBron led the team with 31 points while J.R. Smith chipped in 28 points, going 8/12 on threes and setting a Cavaliers franchise record for made threes in a playoff game. The game was tied 63–63 in the 3rd quarter. However, the Cavs, led by Smith's hot shooting, went on a 22–4 run (including an 11–0 run to start the fourth quarter) as they went up 85–67 and seized control. The Hawks would attempt to mount a rally, cutting an 18-point deficit down to 4 with under 50 seconds remaining. However, James drove through the lane and made a dunk to put the Cavs up 6. After Paul Millsap missed a three that would have made it a one possession game with 23 seconds remaining, the Cavs made their free throws to close it out.\n\nWith Irving sitting out due to injury, the Hawks were in a great position to even up the series. However, the Cavaliers blew out the Hawks and took a commanding 2–0 series lead, winning 94–82. The Cavs led 54–49 at halftime. Coming out of halftime, the Cavs seized control, outscoring the Hawks 30–17 in the third quarter, leading by as many as 20 before settling for an 84–66 lead heading into the 4th quarter. The Cavs scored only 10 points in the final period, but the Hawks trailed by double digits for the entire quarter and failed to make a significant run, managing 16 points. LeBron James led the way for the Cavs, scoring 30 points while having 11 assists and 9 rebounds. Dennis Schroder led the Hawks in scoring with 13 points off the bench. It was the first time this season that the Hawks had lost consecutive home games. The game was memorable when Hawks' 3-point specialist Kyle Korver sprained his right ankle after the Cavs' Matthew Dellavedova fell on his right leg while attempting to dive for a loose ball. This injury kept Korver out for the rest of the postseason and would require surgery in the off-season along with an injured elbow that bothered him for most of the season.\n\nIn a pivotal Game 3, LeBron James got off to an awful start, going 0/9 in the first quarter as the Hawks led 24–21. Near the end of the second quarter, Al Horford and Matthew Dellavedova got tangled up on the floor. Horford, who had scored 15 points on 7/10 shooting in the first half, swung his elbow at Dellavedova. He received a Flagrant 2 foul and was ejected. The Hawks led 49–48 at halftime. However, the Cavs would dominate the third quarter again, outscoring the Hawks 33–27 to take a 5-point lead into the 4th quarter. The Cavs led by as many 10 in the 4th quarter, leading 88–78. However, the Hawks, led by Jeff Teague, would go on a 26–12 run, taking a four-point lead with just under 1:45 to play. The Cavs scored the final four points of regulation to tie up the game. The Hawks had the final possession of regulation. However, Teague's potential game winning three missed at the buzzer, and the game went into overtime. With just under one minute to play in overtime, the Hawks trailed 109–108. Teague hit a three pointer over Thompson to put the Hawks up 111–109. On the Cavs' next possession, James attempted a jumper that rimmed out. However, Thompson grabbed the offensive rebound and passed it back to James. James went behind the three point line and shot a three that went down, putting the Cavs back ahead 112–111. Out of the timeout, the Hawks turned it over on their next possession. On the Cavs' next possession, James ran the shot clock down before driving into the paint and making a layup to put the Cavs up 114–111. The Hawks had two chances to tie the game and potentially force a second overtime, but Shelvin Mack missed both game tying three point attempts, sending the Hawks to their third straight loss as the Cavs went up 3–0 in the series. James recorded his 51st career triple-double (12th of the postseason) with 37 points, 18 rebounds, and 13 assists. Teague led the Hawks with 30 points. \n\nAfter missing the last two games against the Hawks, Irving made his return to the lineup.\nThe Cavaliers routed the Hawks by 30 points, dominating from start to finish. The Cavs led 32–20 after the first quarter and never looked back. After leading by 17 at halftime, the Cavs controlled the entire second half. The Cavs led 85–60 heading into the fourth quarter, a quarter where very few starters logged minutes. The Cavaliers went on to win 118–88 as the franchise clinched their second Eastern Conference Championship in franchise history and returned to the Finals for the first time since 2007. The Atlanta Hawks became the first #1 seed to be swept in the Conference Finals since the Nets swept the Pistons in the 2003 Conference Finals. LeBron James and James Jones also became the first non-Celtics to appear in five consecutive NBA Finals series.\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Cavaliers winning the only prior meeting.\n\nWestern Conference finals\n(1) Golden State Warriors vs. (2) Houston Rockets\nIn Game 5, James Harden set an NBA playoff record for turnovers, with 12. The record was previously held by John Williamson of the New Jersey Nets with 11 in 1979.\n\nThis was the first meeting in the playoffs between the Warriors and Rockets.\n\nNBA Finals: (W1) Golden State Warriors vs. (E2) Cleveland Cavaliers\nThis was the first meeting in the NBA Finals between the Warriors and Cavaliers.\n\nStatistical leaders\nMedia coverage\nTelevision\nESPN, TNT, ABC, ESPN2 and NBA TV broadcast the NBA Playoffs nationally.

    "2016 NBA playoffs": "The 2016 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s 2015–16 season. The tournament ended with the Eastern Conference champion Cleveland Cavaliers defeating the defending NBA champion and Western Conference champion Golden State Warriors 4 games to 3 after the Warriors led the series 3 games to 1. In the NBA Finals, LeBron James was named NBA Finals MVP.\nThe Cavaliers swept their first two series and won the first two games of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Raptors to become the fourth team in NBA history to open a post-season with 10 straight victories. They matched the 2012 San Antonio Spurs, though the 1989 and 2001 Western Conference Los Angeles Lakers had won their first eleven games en route to sweeping the first three rounds of those playoffs. Cleveland wound up repeating this feat the next year when they swept the conference opening round, semifinal round, and winning the first 2 conference final games; this feat would be surpassed in those same 2017 NBA playoffs, when the Golden State Warriors won 15 straight games.\n\nOverview\nWestern Conference\nThe Golden State Warriors entered the playoffs with the best regular-season record in NBA history. The Warriors won 73 games, breaking the previous record of 72 wins set by the Chicago Bulls in the 1995–96 season. Golden State appeared in their fourth consecutive postseason for the first time since making six straight appearances from 1947 to 1952. However, they lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Finals.\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder returned to the postseason after a one-season absence.\nThe San Antonio Spurs finished just six games behind the Warriors for the best record in the NBA, entering their 19th consecutive postseason, having just one home loss in the regular season, setting a new single-season franchise record for wins. The Spurs' 40–1 home record equaled the feat set by the 1985–86 Boston Celtics. However, they lost in the Conference Semifinals to the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nEastern Conference\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers earned the top seed in the Eastern Conference for the first time since 2010, the final season of LeBron James' first stint with the Cavaliers.\nThe Toronto Raptors also finished with a franchise record for single-season victories, winning 56 games. They finished one game shy of the Cleveland Cavaliers for the best record in the Eastern Conference. However, they lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Conference Finals.\nThe Detroit Pistons qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 2009.\nThe Miami Heat, Charlotte Hornets, and Indiana Pacers returned to the playoffs after a one-season absence.\nFor the first time since 1999, all teams from the Eastern Conference finished with a better record against at least one team from the Western Conference. In addition, all Eastern Conference teams finished with records over .500 for the first time since 2012.\n\nFirst Round\nGame 4 between the Cavaliers and the Pistons was the last playoff game played at the Palace of Auburn Hills, as well as the last major league postseason game played in Oakland County. The Pistons missed the playoffs the next year and moved to their new arena for the 2017–18 season.\nGame 7 between the Raptors and Pacers and the Heat and Hornets ensured a 17th straight postseason in which at least one Game 7 was played; 1999 was the last postseason to not feature a Game 7.\nWith their Game 7 win over the Pacers, the Raptors won their first playoff series since 2001.\n\nConference Semifinals\nWith their Conference Semifinals victory over the Atlanta Hawks, the Cleveland Cavaliers became the fifth team (since the first round was extended to a best–of–seven series in 2003) to go 8–0 through the first two rounds and the first to do it twice; they first did so in 2009. This also marked the sixth consecutive year that LeBron James played in the Eastern Conference finals. James played in the Conference finals with the Miami Heat from 2011 to 2014, and with the Cavaliers in 2015.\nWith their Game 6 victory over the San Antonio Spurs, the Oklahoma City Thunder made the Western Conference Finals for the third time in five seasons. As of 2023, this remains the most recent Thunder series victory.\nGame 7 of the Eastern Conference semifinals between the Toronto Raptors and Miami Heat marked the first time since 2001 that two teams that played a Game 7 in the previous round of the playoffs faced off against each other in another Game 7 in the next round.\nWith their Game 7 win over the Miami Heat, the Toronto Raptors advanced to the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in their history. This meant they also became the first Canadian–based and non–U.S. team to do so.\n\nConference Finals\nFor the first time since 2010, no Texas team was represented in the Western Conference finals.\nGame 3 of the Eastern Conference finals between the Toronto Raptors and the Cleveland Cavaliers was Toronto's first ever Eastern Conference finals win.\nGame 4 of the Western Conference finals marked the first time that the Golden State Warriors had lost consecutive games during the season.\nWith their Eastern Conference Finals victory over the Toronto Raptors, the Cleveland Cavaliers became the first team in NBA history to go 8–0 in the first two rounds, and qualify to play in the NBA Finals. This also marked the sixth consecutive NBA Finals appearance for LeBron James. He became the first player since the 1960s to accomplish this feat.\nThe Western Conference finals went to a Game 7 for the first time since 2002, when the Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Sacramento Kings in overtime.\nWith their 96–88 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals, the Golden State Warriors became the tenth team in NBA History to come back from a 3–1 series deficit in the playoffs. As a result, this marked the second consecutive season an NBA team rallied from a 3–1 series deficit to win the series. The Warriors also became the first team to accomplish this feat in the Conference finals since the 1981 Boston Celtics.\n\nNBA Finals\nWith their 104–89 and 110–77 wins over Cleveland in Game 1 and 2 of the NBA Finals, the Warriors posted the highest winning margin in the first two games in the NBA Finals with an +48 point differential.\nThanks to the Cleveland Cavaliers’ 120–90 Game 3 victory, the Golden State Warriors lost every Game 3 of their 2016 playoff run.\nDraymond Green became the first NBA player to be suspended for an NBA Finals game since Jerry Stackhouse in 2006. He was suspended for Game 5, due to incurring excessive flagrant foul points in Game 4 (in which the Warriors won 108–97).\nIn Game 5, LeBron James and Kyrie Irving became the first pair to each record 40+ points in a single NBA Finals game in history, helping the Cavaliers win 112–97.\nIn Game 6, Stephen Curry, the unanimous MVP of the regular season, was ejected for throwing a mouthpiece in the fourth quarter. His Golden State Warriors would go on to lose 101–115.\nThe NBA Finals went to a Game 7 for the first time since 2013, when the Miami Heat defeated the San Antonio Spurs 95–88.\n\nGame 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals\nGame 7 of the NBA Finals was extremely notable for The Block (basketball), in which LeBron James blocked a layup by Andre Iguodala to keep the score tied at 89. This block, along with Kyrie Irving's title winning three pointer would seal the win for the Cleveland Cavaliers.\nWith the win, the Cleveland Cavaliers became the first team to win Game 7 of the NBA Finals on the road since the 1978 Washington Bullets accomplished the feat against the Seattle SuperSonics. They also became the first team overall to win a Game 7 on the road since the Brooklyn Nets (which was also decided on a game-winning block).\nWith the loss, the Golden State Warriors became the first team to overcome a 3–1 series deficit and blow a 3–1 series lead in the same playoffs. They also became the first team in NBA History to win 70+ regular season games and fail to win the NBA Championship.\nThe Cavaliers became the 11th team to overcome a 3–1 series deficit and the first to do so in the NBA Finals. It is also the first time in playoff history two NBA teams rallied from a 3–1 deficit in the same year. They also clinched Cleveland's first major sports title since 1964, effectively ending the Cleveland sports curse.\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers became the first team since the 2006 Miami Heat to win an NBA Championship despite a midseason coaching change and despite trailing 2–0 (they became the fourth team overall to win the NBA Finals despite losing the first two games).\nThe title the Cleveland Cavaliers won was clinched on Father's Day for the fourth time in NBA history (the previous occurrences were in 1996, 2003, and 2014). It also marked the first time since 2014 that when both teams made back-to-back Finals appearances, the team that lost in the Finals the year before won the title the next year.\n\nFormat\nWithin each conference, the eight teams with the most wins qualify for the playoffs. The seedings are based on each team's record.\nEach conference's bracket is fixed; there is no reseeding. All rounds are best-of-seven series; the team that has four wins advances to the next round. As stated above, all rounds, including the NBA Finals, are in a 2–2–1–1–1 format. The rule for determining home court advantage in the NBA Finals is winning percentage, then head-to-head record, followed by record vs. opposite conference.\n\nSeeding\nOn September 8, 2015, the NBA announced changes to how playoff teams were seeded. Previously, the division champions were guaranteed no worse than the fourth seed, while the team with the second-best record in the conference was guaranteed no worse than the second seed even if it wasn't a division champion. Starting with the 2016 playoffs, the eight playoff qualifiers in each conference will be seeded solely based on regular-season record. If two teams finish with identical records, the team that wins the regular-season series will get the higher seed. If the regular-season series is tied and one of the teams is a division champion, the division champion will get the higher seed. If three or more teams finish with identical records and one of the teams is a division champion, the division champion will get the higher seed.\n\nPlayoff qualifying\nOn February 27, 2016, the Golden State Warriors became the first team to clinch a playoff spot. This was the earliest a team had clinched a playoff spot in February since the 1987–88 Los Angeles Lakers. The Cleveland Cavaliers became the first Eastern Conference team to clinch a playoff spot on March 18, 2016.\n\nEastern Conference\nWestern Conference\nNotes\n\nBracket\nTeams in bold advanced to the next round. The numbers to the left of each team indicate the team's seeding in its conference, and the numbers to the right indicate the number of games the team won in that round. The division champions are marked by an asterisk. Teams with home court advantage are shown in Italics.\n\nFirst round\nAll times are in Eastern Daylight Time (UTC−04:00)\n\nEastern Conference first round\n(1) Cleveland Cavaliers vs. (8) Detroit Pistons\nIn Game 3, Kyrie Irving hit the tough corner 3 late in the 4th quarter, with only 0.7 seconds remaining on the shot clock. In Game 4, Irving also hit a three to give the Cavaliers a 4-point lead with less than a minute left. Reggie Jackson would then drive and dunk the ball to cut the lead to 2. As Irving attempted another clutch 3, it went short and the players scrambled for the ball until the Pistons came up with it. As they looked for a 3 to force Game 5, or a 2 to send it to overtime, they look to Reggie Jackson. He took a 3 over Irving, but that went short as well, and the Cavaliers move on to the second round. Game 4 was also the last playoff game ever played at The Palace of Auburn Hills.\n\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Cavaliers winning two out of the first three meetings.\n\n(2) Toronto Raptors vs. (7) Indiana Pacers\nThe Raptors won their first playoff series since the 2001 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals\n\nThis was the first meeting in the playoffs between the Raptors and Pacers.\n\n(3) Miami Heat vs. (6) Charlotte Hornets\nWith the series tied at two games apiece, Game 5 was a close one. After Kemba Walker misses a stepback jumper over Hassan Whiteside, Courtney Lee gets the offensive rebound and hits a clutch 3 with 25.2 seconds left. The Hornets then block 2 shots to seal it. It was their first playoff road win since game 4 of the 2002 playoffs against the Orlando Magic. By then, Charlotte was on the verge of an upset, but in Game 6, Dwyane Wade wouldn't let his team down. Although he hasn't hit a three since December 2015, he hits 2 clutch shots including a three with less than a minute to go, as the series goes back to Miami for a Game 7. There, the Heat closed out the series and advance to the second round, to face the Toronto Raptors, who also moved on to the second round for the first time since 2001.\n\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Heat winning the most recent meeting in 2014.\n\n(4) Atlanta Hawks vs. (5) Boston Celtics\nThis was the 12th playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Celtics winning ten of the first eleven meetings.\n\nWestern Conference first round\n(1) Golden State Warriors vs. (8) Houston Rockets\nThe Warriors, after game 1, went through games 2 and 3 without Stephen Curry. He injured his ankle and would be lost until game 4. Game 4 saw him injure his knee, as he slipped on a wet spot on the floor at the Toyota Center in Houston. Curry's Warriors teammates stepped up and blew out the Rockets by 27 points. They would close out the series by blowing the Rockets out again, by 33 points.\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the first meeting being in 2015, as Golden State defeated Houston 4–1 in the Western Conference finals.\n\n(2) San Antonio Spurs vs. (7) Memphis Grizzlies\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with San Antonio winning the most recent meeting in 2013.\n\n(3) Oklahoma City Thunder vs. (6) Dallas Mavericks\nThis was the fifth playoff meeting between these two teams, with each team winning two of the four meetings.\n\n(4) Los Angeles Clippers vs. (5) Portland Trail Blazers\nThis was the first meeting in the playoffs between the Clippers and Trail Blazers.\n\nConference semifinals\nEastern Conference semifinals\n(1) Cleveland Cavaliers vs. (4) Atlanta Hawks\nIn Game 2, the Cavaliers made history by hitting 18 three-pointers in the first half and 25 overall to break the record for most three-point field goals made by a team in a game. During Game 3's final minute, Jeff Teague pushed LeBron James into a Hawks fan, James would later claim that he was still okay. In Game 4, both teams were locked in battle until in the final seconds, a jump ball was called between Dennis Schröder and LeBron James, and the Hawks desperately won the tip, but the game-winning shot by Paul Millsap bounced off the rim as the Cavs make a second straight sweep.\nThis was the third time the Cavaliers swept the Hawks in the playoffs and it would be the second consecutive season the Cavaliers swept them.\n\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Cavaliers winning the first two meetings.\n\n(2) Toronto Raptors vs. (3) Miami Heat\nEven though the Raptors lost Game 1, Kyle Lowry hits a game-tying shot from half-court at the buzzer to force overtime. The play is similar to Chauncey Billups' half-court buzzer beater against the Nets in the 2004 playoffs, that also forced overtime. The end of Game 7 marks the Raptors' first ever trip to the Eastern Conference finals in their history.\nGame 7 is noteworthy as being Dwyane Wade's last game with the Miami Heat (during his first stint with the team) as he would sign with the Chicago Bulls in the off-season. He would return to the Miami Heat in 2018 after being traded for a second-round pick by the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nThis was the first meeting in the playoffs between the Raptors and Heat.\n\nWestern Conference semifinals\n(1) Golden State Warriors vs. (5) Portland Trail Blazers\nIn Game 4, when Stephen Curry came back from his knee injury, he scored 40 points, along with an NBA record 17 points in overtime to lead the Warriors to a 132–125 win. They closed out the series in Game 5, to advance and face the Oklahoma City Thunder, who defeated the 67-win San Antonio Spurs in their second round matchup.\n\nThis was the first meeting in the playoffs between the Warriors and Trail Blazers.\n\n(2) San Antonio Spurs vs. (3) Oklahoma City Thunder\nGame 6 is Tim Duncan's final NBA game.\n\nThis was the sixth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Spurs winning four of the first five meetings.\n\nConference finals\nEastern Conference finals\n(1) Cleveland Cavaliers vs. (2) Toronto Raptors\nGames 1 and 2 were easy victories for the Cavaliers, as they pushed their playoff winning streak to 10 consecutive games. However, in Game 3, the Raptors dominated the first half, building up an 18-point lead, the largest deficit the Cavaliers faced all playoffs long. J.R. Smith's hot three-point shooting tried to lead Cleveland back, cutting the lead to 5, but the Raptors inevitably held on to win the game. DeMar DeRozan scored 32 points and Bismack Biyombo grabbed a Raptors' franchise record 26 rebounds. This loss by Cleveland ended their playoff winning streak at 10 games. Things would get worse in Game 4 as the Cavs were unable to slow down Kyle Lowry who scored 20 first-half points. Cleveland once again attempted a second half comeback, only this time they turned the game into a back and forth battle. Lowry's drive and score at the basket sealed the win for Toronto, tying the series at 2 games apiece. It was time for recovery for James and the Cavaliers in Game 5. They delivered yet another blowout victory, as they took a 3–2 series lead. The Raptors needed a win back home to force a decisive Game 7, but the Cavaliers closed out the series in Game 6 and won their second straight Eastern Conference title. For the sixth consecutive season, LeBron James advances to the NBA Finals, along with his teammate, James Jones.\n\nThis was the first ever meeting in any professional sports league's postseason between teams from Cleveland and Toronto. Teams from the two cities met again less than five months later (and again in the penultimate round of the playoffs) when the Cleveland Indians beat the Toronto Blue Jays in the 2016 American League Championship Series.\n\nWestern Conference finals\n(1) Golden State Warriors vs. (3) Oklahoma City Thunder\nDuring the Thunder-Warriors series, Draymond Green became the subject of multiple controversial plays against Oklahoma City \nplayers, most notably Steven Adams.\nIn Game 1, the Thunder upset the Warriors 108–102 and took a 1–0 series lead. It marked the Warriors' first loss at Oracle Arena in Oakland in the playoffs, as well as their third home loss of the \nseason. In Game 2, despite a close game at the half, the Warriors soundly defeated the Thunder 118–91. Television cameras appeared to show Draymond Green kicking Steven Adams in the groin while he was \nattempting a layup. In Game 3, in the comfort of a raucous Chesapeake Energy Arena, the Thunder dominated the Warriors 133–105. During the game, Green \nreceived a flagrant foul 1 for again appearing to kick Adams in the groin. In Game 4, the Thunder once again handed the Warriors a commanding 118–94 defeat to take a 3–1 series lead. Green appeared to trip Enes Kanter during the game.\n Returning to Oracle Arena in Game 5, the Warriors held on to defeat the Thunder 120–111, cutting their series deficit to 3–2. Kevin Durant scored 40 points in the loss. Despite their Game 5 loss, the Thunder were favored to advance to the NBA Finals in the comfort of their home court in Game 6, but the Warriors stunned the Thunder thanks to Klay Thompson, who scored a series-high 41 points and made an NBA playoff record 11 3s. Klay's performance and a poor shooting night from Kevin Durant, as the Warriors won the game 108–101 and tied the series 3-3, forcing a Game 7 in the Bay Area. In Game 7, Oklahoma City built a 13-point lead \nduring the game and led 48–42 at halftime. However, the Thunder lost focus in the third quarter. After the Warriors thwarted Oklahoma City's brief comeback attempt in the fourth quarter, Golden State won 96–88 and became the 10th team to win an NBA playoff series after being down 3 games to 1. Game 7 was the last game Kevin Durant played with the Oklahoma City Thunder, before joining his opponent in this series, the Golden State Warriors.\n\nThis was the third meeting in the playoffs between the Warriors and Thunder, with both teams tied at one a piece.\n\nNBA Finals: (E1) Cleveland Cavaliers vs. (W1) Golden State Warriors\nAfter winning three of the first four games in the Finals with relative ease, the Warriors appeared to be overwhelming the Cavaliers as they moved to being within one win from back-to-back championships. However, the series shifted dramatically after Golden State's All-Star forward, Draymond Green, was suspended for game 5 after an altercation with Cleveland's LeBron James in game 4. Absent Green, the Warriors were lacking defensively, as Kyrie Irving and LeBron James became the first teammates to score 40 or more points each in a Finals game and led the Cavaliers to a 112–97 win to force game 6. Back in the Quicken Loans Arena for their final home game of the season, the Cavaliers tied the series at 3 games apiece by defeating Golden State, 115–101. After receiving his sixth personal foul in the fourth quarter, Stephen Curry was ejected for the first time in his career after throwing his mouthpiece at a Cavaliers fan. Game 7 came down to the wire. Late in the fourth quarter, with the score tied at 89, Andre Iguodala received a bounce pass from Curry. As Iguodala went up for the layup, he was blocked from behind by James, in what has since been recognized as one of the most memorable blocks in NBA playoff history, and among the most iconic plays of James's career. Reverse camera angles showed that James should have been called with goaltending as James's hand had touched the rim. With less than a minute to play, Kyrie Irving converted a 3-point shot to give the Cavaliers the lead. On their next possession, James was fouled by Green while attempting a dunk, and made one of his two free throws to increase the lead to four. While the Warriors managed to get the ball into the hands of Curry for a chance to cut the deficit to one, he was guarded well by Cavaliers big man Kevin Love, and Curry was forced to take a sub par shot that missed, sealing the game as the city of Cleveland, Ohio's 52-year sports curse finally ended. The Cavaliers became the eleventh team to win an NBA playoff series after trailing 3 games to 1, and the first to do so in the NBA Finals. The Warriors became the best team (by regular season record) to fail to capture an NBA championship. Cleveland also became only the fourth team to win Game 7 of the NBA Finals on the road. This was the first NBA championship for the Cavaliers.\n\nThis was the second meeting in the NBA Finals between the Warriors and Cavaliers, with the Warriors winning the first meeting last season.\n\nStatistical leaders\nMedia coverage\nTelevision\nESPN, TNT, ABC, ESPN2, ESPNews and NBA TV broadcast the NBA playoffs nationally in the United States.

(The largest is 39-point set back in 1948, which would be surpassed in the following year when the Warriors defeat Rockets by 41.)\nAfter trailing as much as 21 points, the Boston Celtics surged back with a 28–10 third quarter run against the Cleveland Cavaliers to win Game 3. This was also the Cavaliers' first loss this postseason, as well as their first loss in a postseason game since Game 4 of the previous year's Finals, snapping an NBA playoff record tying 13 game winning streak.\nWith a four-game sweep against the San Antonio Spurs, the Golden State Warriors earned the distinction of having a 12–0 postseason record, the first in NBA history. They are also the first team to have 3 best–of–7 series sweeps, and join the 1988–89 Los Angeles Lakers (who ironically, would get swept themselves by the Detroit Pistons) and the 2000–01 Lakers as the only teams to be undefeated going into the championship round, and the only one to have done it under the 7–7–7–7 format since it was introduced in 2003.\n\nNBA Finals\nThe Golden State Warriors began the finals with a playoff record of 12–0. They dominated the first two games, and although game three was more competitive, the Warriors still came out victors. They took a 3–0 lead bringing them to 15–0 in the playoffs, the best ever start in NBA playoff history. The Cavs countered beating the Warriors 137–116 in Game four, with 86 points in the first half, setting an NBA Finals' record. On June 12, the Warriors bounced back and won game five at home 129–120, clinching the organization's fifth championship. Golden State's 16–1 record is an NBA playoff record since 2003 for fewest games attempted to achieve an NBA championship. The title was the first for All–Star forward Kevin Durant and the second in three years for All–Stars Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green. Durant, who scored over 30 points in each of the five games (the first player to do so since Shaquille O'Neal in 2000 with Los Angeles), was the recipient of the 2017 Bill Russell NBA Finals MVP award.\n\nFormat\nWithin each conference, the eight teams with the most wins qualify for the playoffs. The seedings are based on each team's record.\nEach conference's bracket is fixed; there is no reseeding. All rounds are best-of-seven series; the team that has four wins advances to the next round. As stated above, all rounds, including the NBA Finals, are in a 2–2–1–1–1 format. Home court advantage in any round belongs to the higher-seeded team, who has the better regular season record. If two teams with the same record meet in a round, standard tiebreaker rules are used. The rule for determining home court advantage in the NBA Finals is winning percentage, then head-to-head record, followed by record vs. opposite conference.\n\nPlayoff qualifying\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers became the first Eastern Conference team to clinch a playoff spot on March 19, 2017.\n\nEastern Conference\nWestern Conference\nBracket\nTeams in bold advanced to the next round.

The Celtics' win in Game 5 would be the only home game victory of the series, and Avery Bradley scored 23 points in Game 6 as the Celtics eliminated the Bulls. Notably, this series began one day following the death of Chyna Thomas, younger sister of Isaiah, in a one-car accident. Thomas played all six games of the series, before returning to the state of Washington for her funeral on April 29. Game 6 also marked the final game of Jimmy Butler's tenure as a Bull.\n\nThis was the fifth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Celtics winning the first four meetings.\n\n(2) Cleveland Cavaliers vs. (7) Indiana Pacers\nIn Game 1, LeBron James scored 32 points in a close battle; the Pacers came back in the 4th quarter, but C.J. Miles missed a game-winning three, giving the Cavaliers the win. But after winning Game 2, the Cavs were down by as many as 26 points in the first half of Game 3. The Pacers were in control until the Cavs led by James' triple-double of 41 points, 13 rebounds and 12 assists came roaring back in the second half and took the lead late in the fourth quarter. They would end up winning Game 3, 119–114, as they made it one of the largest comebacks in NBA playoff history. With the Pacers holding a 2-point lead with over a minute left in Game 4, James hits the three over Myles Turner, giving the Cavs a one-point lead. Later, Kyle Korver's free throws increases the lead to three. The Pacers had a chance to extend the game, but Paul George missed the three, and James gets the rebound. He would make 1 of the 2 free throws to seal the Cavs' 4-game sweep over the Pacers. Game 4 would be George's final game as a Pacer.\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Pacers winning the first meeting.\n\n(3) Toronto Raptors vs. (6) Milwaukee Bucks\nThis was the first meeting in the playoffs between the Raptors and Bucks.\n\n(4) Washington Wizards vs. (5) Atlanta Hawks\nThis was the sixth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Wizards/Bullets winning three of the first five meetings.\n\nWestern Conference first round\n(1) Golden State Warriors vs. (8) Portland Trail Blazers\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with Golden State winning the first meeting in 2016.\n\n(2) San Antonio Spurs vs. (7) Memphis Grizzlies\nIn game 4, Marc Gasol hits the game winning shot with 0.7 seconds left in overtime.\n\nThis was the fifth playoff meeting between these two teams, with San Antonio winning three of the four meetings.\n\n(3) Houston Rockets vs. (6) Oklahoma City Thunder\nThis was the eighth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Thunder/SuperSonics winning six of the first seven meetings.\n\n(4) Los Angeles Clippers vs. (5) Utah Jazz\nIn Game 1, Joe Johnson hits the game-winner at the buzzer.\n\nGame 7 is Paul Pierce's final NBA game.

Memorably, during the first quarter of Game 1, Isaiah Thomas was struck in the mouth by Otto Porter'selbow, immediately knocking out one tooth, and causing further damage. As Porter prepared to shoot a pair of free throws, Thomas calmly retrieved and pocketed his fallen tooth, then hit two three-point field goals in the following two minutes, before being pulled from the game for medical attention. Thomas went on to play the entire seven-game series, including a 53-point effort to lead his team to an overtime victory in Game 2, all while wearing temporary protection in his mouth. He underwent extensive oral surgery after the playoffs to mitigate the damage.\n\n(2) Cleveland Cavaliers vs. (3) Toronto Raptors\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with Cleveland winning the first meeting in 2016.\n\nWestern Conference semifinals\n(1) Golden State Warriors vs. (5) Utah Jazz\nThis was Gordon Hayward's last game in Utah as he joined the Boston Celtics during the following offseason.\n\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Warriors winning two of the first three meetings.\n\n(2) San Antonio Spurs vs. (3) Houston Rockets\nIn Game 5, Manu Ginóbili blocked James Harden's game-tying 3-point attempt in overtime before the buzzer sounded.\n\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Rockets winning the first three meetings.\n\nConference finals\nEastern Conference finals\n(1) Boston Celtics vs. (2) Cleveland Cavaliers\nThis was Isaiah Thomas' last game in Boston as a hip injury would not allow him to dress for the remainder of the playoffs.

In the final seconds (6.7 seconds to be exact) with the Rockets up 96–94, the Warriors had one last chance to tie or take the lead in the game, Draymond Green however lost his balance and turned the ball over to Eric Gordon who was then fouled and sealed the game making both of his free throws sending Houston within 1 game to their first trip to the NBA Finals since 1995, but it came at a cost however as Chris Paul suffered a \"right hamstring injury\" in the final minute, he did not play for the rest of the series.\nKevin Durant scored 29 points while Draymond Green had 15 rebounds & Stephen Curry had 6 assists for the Warriors\n\nEric Gordon scored 24 points while Clint Capela scored 14 rebounds & Chris Paul with 6 assists for the Rockets.\nGolden State rallied from a 17-point first quarter deficit by outscoring Houston 64–25 in the second half to force a Game 7.

If the venue is located in a different time zone, the local time is also given.\n\nGame 1 would go on to be an instant classic, with LeBron James scoring 51 points. The game was tight throughout, as neither team was able to gain separation. However, the final minutes did not come without controversy as Durant seemingly charged onto James when driving to the basket. The officials reviewed that James was not within the restricted area, and the call was then reversed into a blocking foul, thus allowing Durant to tie the game with a pair of free throws. Eventually, when the Warriors were leading 107–106, James passed the ball that went out of bounds while George Hill was fouled, thus giving him a pair of free throws. After making the first free throw to tie it at 107, he missed the second free throw, which was rebounded by J.R. Smith, who ran the clock as it was perceived that he believed the Cavaliers had the lead. He passed the ball to Hill, whose shot was blocked by Draymond Green at the buzzer. The Warriors dominated overtime 17–7 as they won the series opener 124–114. Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, and Klay Thompson respectively scored 29, 26, and 24 points. In Game 2, the Warriors blew out the Cavs 122–103 as Curry sinked in 9 three-pointers and finished with 33 points and Durant dropped 26 points. The Warriors sent more double teams on James, holding him to 29 points. As Game 3 shifted to Cleveland, the Cavaliers dominated the first half, leading by as many as 13. Curry and Thompson, the Splash Brothers, had a bad night only combining for only 21 points on 7-27 shooting. However, in the second half, the Warriors fought back, making it a back-and-forth game as Kevin Durant scored 43 points, and made a key clutch shot in the closing minutes that put the Warriors up 106–100, and eventually winning 110–102 to put the Warriors up 3–0 for the second straight year. After a close first half in Game 4, the Warriors dominated the third quarter and routed the Cavaliers 108–85 behind Stephen Curry's 37 points and seven three-pointers, as well as a triple-double by Durant, thus completing the sweep. Durant won Finals MVP for the second straight year behind averages of 28.8 points, 10.8 rebounds and 7.5 assists, while Curry averaged 27.5 points for the series. LeBron James led both teams in scoring and assists, putting up averages of 34.0 points and 10.0 assists in a losing effort.\n\nThis was the fourth meeting in the NBA Finals between these two teams, with the Warriors winning two of the first three meetings.\n\nStatistical leaders\nMedia coverage\nTelevision\nESPN, TNT, ABC, NBA TV, ESPN2, and ESPNews televised the playoffs nationally in the United States.

The last time a Game 7 did not take place in the playoffs was in 1999.\nAll of the top seeds won the first round for the first time since 2008.\n\nConference semifinals\nGame 3 of the Trail Blazers–Nuggets series was the first quadruple overtime game played in the playoffs since 1955 (and second overall), as well as the first quadruple overtime game ever played during the shot clock era.\nWith their conference semifinals victory over the Boston Celtics, the Milwaukee Bucks made the Eastern Conference finals for the first time since 2001. In addition, this was the first time since 1983 that the Bucks defeated the Celtics in a playoff series.\nKawhi Leonard scored the first Game 7 buzzer-beater in NBA history, helping the Toronto Raptors defeat the Philadelphia 76ers 92–90 in the second round.\nGame 7 of the Nuggets–Blazers series was extremely notable for CJ McCollum's block on Jamal Murray, evoking memories of a similar block in 2016.\nWith their Game 7 victory Portland Trail Blazers advanced to the Western Conference finals for the first time since 2000. They also won a Game 7 on the road for the first time in franchise history.\nThe Warriors–Rockets series is notable for Stephen Curry's 33–point second half. With their series victory, they advanced to the Western Conference finals for the fifth consecutive season.\n\nConference finals\nStephen Curry (Warriors) and Seth Curry (Portland Trail Blazers) played each other in the Western Conference finals, becoming the first set of brothers to face each other in an NBA playoff series.\nWith their Western Conference finals sweep against the Portland Trail Blazers, the Golden State Warriors earned their fifth consecutive trip to the NBA Finals, making them the second franchise in the NBA postseason history to do so after the Boston Celtics did it in ten consecutive years, starting from 1957 to 1966.\nThe Portland Trail Blazers earned the dubious distinction of losing three straight games to the Golden State Warriors despite posting double digit leads in Games 2, 3, and 4.\nWith their Eastern Conference finals victory over the Milwaukee Bucks, the Toronto Raptors advanced on to the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history.\nStephen Curry surpassed Shaquille O'Neal for most points in a sweep with 146 points.\n\nNBA Finals\nThe Toronto Raptors won the NBA Championship for the first time in franchise history, defeating the Golden State Warriors in six games in the 2019 NBA Finals.\nGame 1 was the first ever NBA Finals game played outside the US.\nKawhi Leonard joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and LeBron James as the only players to win Finals MVP with more than one team, and became the first Finals MVP winner from both conferences.\nGame 6 of the 2019 NBA Finals was the last NBA game ever played at Oracle Arena, as well as the final NBA game ever played in Oakland.\nGame 5 of the Warriors–Raptors series was extremely notable as Kevin Durant ruptured his Achilles in an attempt to return to the playoffs, previously injuring it whilst playing the Clippers.\n\nFormat\nWithin each conference, the eight teams with the most wins qualified for the playoffs. The seedings were based on each team's record.\nEach conference's bracket was fixed; there was no reseeding. All rounds were best-of-seven series; the series ended when one team won four games, and that team advanced to the next round. All rounds, including the NBA Finals, were in a 2–2–1–1–1 format. In the conference playoffs, home court advantage went to the higher-seeded team (number one being the highest). Seeding was based on each team's regular season record within a conference; if two teams had the same record, standard tiebreaker rules were used. Conference seedings were ignored for the NBA Finals: Home court advantage went to the team with the better regular season record, and, if needed, ties were broken based on head-to-head record, followed by intra-conference record.\n\nPlayoff qualifying\nOn March 1, 2019, the Milwaukee Bucks became the first team to clinch a playoff spot.\n\nEastern Conference\nWestern Conference\nNotes\n\nBracket\nTeams in bold advanced to the next round.

After a Toronto timeout, Leonard was given the ball, dribbled around the perimeter and shot it from the baseline, just inside the three-point arc. The shot bounced four times on the rim before going in to give the Raptors the series win. It was the first buzzer-beater to win a Game 7 in NBA history, and only the second such shot in a winner-take-all playoff game, after Michael Jordan's shot to win the Chicago Bulls' 1989 first-round series against the Cleveland Cavaliers.

For Thursday games, TNT had them in the first round and ESPN in the second round. ABC then aired selected first and second-round games on Friday through Sunday. NBA TV also televised selected games in the first round on Tuesday through Thursday. Also in the first round, regional sports networks affiliated with the teams could also broadcast the games, except for weekend games televised on ABC. The Western Conference finals were televised on ESPN, while TNT televised the Eastern Conference finals. ABC had exclusive television rights to the 2019 NBA Finals, which was the 17th consecutive year for the network.\nIn Canada, the home market of the Toronto Raptors, national broadcast rights were split approximately equally between the Sportsnet and TSN groups of channels, with some conflicting non-Raptors games airing on NBA TV Canada. Separate Canadian broadcasts were produced for all games involving the Raptors regardless of round or U.S. broadcaster. One TSN telecast of a conference semifinal game involving the Raptors was simulcast over the co-owned CTV broadcast network. For the NBA Finals, in addition to the Canadian cable telecasts, most games also aired on either Citytv, CTV, or CTV 2 (broadcast networks co-owned with Sportsnet and TSN respectively), using the ABC feed for simultaneous substitution purposes.\n\nNotes\n\nSee also\nNBA records\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nBasketball – Reference.com's 2019 Playoffs section",
    "2020 NBA playoffs": "The 2020 NBA playoffs were the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 2019–20 season. The playoffs were originally scheduled to begin on April 18. However, the league suspended the season on March 11, 2020, hours after the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and after Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive for the virus.\nOn June 4, the NBA Board of Governors approved a plan to restart the season on July 31 in the NBA Bubble. This proposal was then approved by members of the National Basketball Players Association on June 5. Under this plan, the 22 top teams in the league at the time of the suspension (all the teams who had a mathematical chance at making the playoffs under the 82-game season) played eight additional regular season games to determine playoff seeding, with 16 of those teams playing in a conventional postseason tournament. If the ninth seed within a conference would have finished the regular season within four games of the eighth seed, they would have then competed in a play–in series. The last time a play-in game was played to determine a playoff spot was in 1956.\nAs part of the bubble, all playoff games were held at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex inside Walt Disney World in Bay Lake, Florida.\nAll three games that were scheduled to take place on August 26 were postponed by a wildcat strike, in response to the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, with the Milwaukee Bucks being the first team not to take the court prior to their game five matchup against the Orlando Magic. The games on August 27 and 28 were also postponed, with games resuming on August 29.\nThe Toronto Raptors were defending champions but lost in the Eastern Conference semifinals round to the Boston Celtics. None of the teams that made it to the conference finals in the 2019 NBA playoffs made the conference finals in 2020. These were the first playoffs since 1997 without the San Antonio Spurs, as they were eliminated from playoff contention on August 14, 2020, ending what was then the longest active playoff streak in the NBA and in the four major sports leagues in North America.\n\nOverview\nWestern Conference\nThe Houston Rockets entered their eighth consecutive postseason.\nThe Portland Trail Blazers entered their seventh consecutive postseason. They also became the first Western Conference team since 1997 to qualify for the playoffs despite posting a losing record.\nThe Los Angeles Lakers made the playoffs for the first time in seven years.\nThe Dallas Mavericks made the playoffs for the first time in four years.\nThe Golden State Warriors missed the playoffs for the first time in eight years.\nDespite being invited to the bubble, the San Antonio Spurs missed the playoffs for the first time in twenty-three years. This was only the fifth time since the merger that the Spurs missed the playoffs.\nDespite the Phoenix Suns going a perfect 8–0 in the bubble, they missed the playoffs due to the Grizzlies defeating the Bucks and the Blazers defeating the Nets earlier in the day.\n\nEastern Conference\nThe Toronto Raptors entered their seventh consecutive postseason.\nThe Boston Celtics entered their sixth consecutive postseason.\nThe Indiana Pacers entered their fifth consecutive postseason.\nThe Milwaukee Bucks entered their fourth consecutive postseason.\nThe Orlando Magic entered their second consecutive postseason.\nThe Brooklyn Nets entered their second consecutive postseason.\nThe Miami Heat returned to the postseason after a one-year absence.\n\nFirst round\nThis was the first time since 2003 that both No. 1 seeds (the Milwaukee Bucks and the Los Angeles Lakers) from each conference lost their opening game of the playoffs.\nLeBron James became the first player with 20+ points, 15+ rebounds, and 15+ assists in an NBA playoff game.\nThe Boston Celtics swept the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round, marking the 44th straight year a sweep occurred in the NBA playoffs. The last year a sweep did not occur in the playoffs was 1976.\nThe Toronto Raptors swept the Brooklyn Nets, making it their first series sweep in franchise history, leaving the Los Angeles Clippers as the only remaining team that has never swept a series in the playoffs.\nWith their first round sweep of the Indiana Pacers, the Miami Heat swept a playoff series for the first time since 2014.\nDonovan Mitchell and Jamal Murray joined Michael Jordan and Allen Iverson as the only players to have multiple 50–point games in a single playoff series.\nThis was the first time in NBA playoff history that two players on opposing teams (Donovan Mitchell of the Utah Jazz and Jamal Murray of the Denver Nuggets) tallied 50+ points in the same game.\nLuka Dončić joined Charles Barkley and Oscar Robertson as the only players with 40+ points, 15+ rebounds, 10+ assists in an NBA playoff game.\nLuka Dončić joined Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, and Damian Lillard as the only players to score 40+ points and hit a buzzer–beater in a playoff game.\nThe Milwaukee Bucks were the first team in the playoffs to refuse to play a game over racial injustice in the wake of the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The players described their actions as a \"boycott\", although commentators have pointed out that the event was a strike. It is the first time an NBA team refused to play a game since the Boston Celtics protested for racial justice in 1961.\nKawhi Leonard was the first player to have 30+ points, 10+ rebounds, 5+ assists and 5+ steals in a playoff game since Gary Payton in 2000.\nThe Nuggets–Jazz series was the first of the 2020 playoffs to have a Game 7, making it the 21st consecutive NBA postseason with a Game 7. The last time a Game 7 did not take place in the playoffs was 1999.\nJamal Murray was the first player to have three straight playoff games with 40+ points since Allen Iverson in 2001.\nThe Denver Nuggets became just the 12th team in NBA history to come back from a 3–1 series deficit, when they defeated the Utah Jazz in the Western Conference first round. They were the first team to come back from a 3–1 series deficit since the Cleveland Cavaliers did so in the 2016 NBA Finals.\nLuguentz Dort became the youngest player and first undrafted player to score 30+ points in a Game 7.\n\nConference semifinals\nGame 2 between the Miami Heat and Milwaukee Bucks was the first playoff game since Game 1 of the 1979 NBA Finals to be decided by free throws with time expired.\nThis was the first time that the top two seeds in a conference (the Milwaukee Bucks and the Toronto Raptors in the Eastern Conference) were both down 0–2 in a best–of–7 series.\nThis was the first time since 2013 that the fifth seed (Miami Heat) beat the first seed (Milwaukee Bucks) 4–1 in the conference semifinals.\nDespite all the games being in the same location, the Celtics–Raptors series was the first series in NBA history where the (designated) road team won every game of a best–of–seven series. The only other instances when this had happened in major North American sports leagues history are the 2019 World Series and the 2023 American League Championship Series, in which the Houston Astros lost both series.\nWith their conference semifinals victory over the Los Angeles Clippers, the Denver Nuggets also became the thirteenth NBA team to overcome a 3–1 deficit in the NBA playoffs, and the first time that an NBA team overcame a 3–1 deficit twice in the same playoffs.\n\nConference finals\nThis was the first time that neither the first seed nor the second seed were in the Eastern Conference finals. By coincidence, this would happen again the very next year.\nTyler Herro set the NBA rookie conference finals scoring record by scoring a career–high 37 points off the bench in game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Boston Celtics. The record was previously held by Andrew Toney who scored 35 in 1981. Herro's 37 points are the second-most ever scored by a player aged 20 or younger in a playoff game, only behind Magic Johnson's 42 points back in 1980.\nWith their Eastern Conference finals victory over the Boston Celtics, the Miami Heat became the first 5th seed or lower team to advance to the NBA Finals since the 1999 New York Knicks became the first eighth seed to make the NBA Finals. Ironically, the Knicks eliminated the Heat en route to their 1999 NBA Finals appearance.\n\nNBA Finals\nThis was the first time that both teams in the NBA Finals failed to make the playoffs in the previous season.\nAndre Iguodala reached the NBA Finals for the sixth consecutive year, joining LeBron James and James Jones as the only players to do so with two different teams.\nBefore this season, the last time the Heat reached the NBA Finals was in 2014, after which LeBron James ended a four-year stint with the team. James became the second player (after Wilt Chamberlain in 1967) to win MVP with a franchise before later playing against that franchise in the Finals. James was the first Finals MVP to play their previous franchise in the Finals.\nAnthony Davis joined Kevin Durant, Michael Jordan, Rick Barry, and Hal Greer as the only players in NBA History to score 30+ points in their first two career NBA Finals games.\nTyler Herro became the youngest player to start an NBA Finals game at 20 years, 256 days during the Game 2 of the 2020 NBA Finals on October 2, 2020. He was eight days younger than Magic Johnson was when he started Game 1 for the Lakers in 1980.\nJimmy Butler became the 3rd player in NBA History to record a 40+ point triple-double in the NBA Finals, joining LeBron James in 2015 and Jerry West in 1969. At the end of Game 3 of the NBA Finals, Butler also became the first player (opponent or teammate) to out-score/-rebound/-assist/ LeBron James in a Finals game.\nWith their Game 6 win over the Miami Heat, the Los Angeles Lakers won their record-tying 17th NBA championship, tying the Boston Celtics as the two teams to win the most NBA championships (17). In addition to winning their first championship since 2010, the Lakers also became the first team since the 2008 Boston Celtics (who ironically defeated them in the 2008 NBA Finals) to win a championship after missing the playoffs the previous season.\nLeBron James became the first NBA player to win the Finals MVP with three different teams and the third to win a championship with three different teams, joining John Salley and Robert Horry.\nDanny Green joins LeBron as the two players to win titles with three different teams.\nRajon Rondo became the second player after Clyde Lovellette to win a title with the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics.\nAnthony Davis became the 8th player to win an Olympic gold medal, NCAA Championship, and NBA Championship, joining Clyde Lovellette, Bill Russell, K.C. Jones, Jerry Lucas, Quinn Buckner, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan\n\nFormat\nAfter the NBA suspended its season on March 11, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the league started to explore implementing a special postseason format just for this year.\nOn June 4, the NBA Board of Governors approved a plan to restart the season on July 31 in the NBA Bubble, with 22 of the 30 teams in the league, all clubs mathematically alive for a playoff spot under the 82 game schedule. Under this plan, the 22 teams played eight regular-season \"seeding\" games. A possible best-of-three play-in series for the final seed in each conference would then be held if the ninth seed finished the regular season within four games of the eighth seed. The eighth seed would start with a de facto 1–0 lead, meaning that it would need just one win to advance, while the ninth seed must win two in a row. The NBA's regular playoff format proceeded as normal. All games were played behind closed doors at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Walt Disney World.\nUnder the NBA's regular playoff format, the eight teams with the most wins in each conference qualified for the playoffs. The seedings were based on each team's record. Each conference's bracket was fixed; there was no reseeding. All rounds were best-of-seven series; the series ended when one team won four games, and that team advanced to the next round. All rounds, including the NBA Finals, were in a 2–2–1–1–1 format. In the conference playoffs, home court advantage went to the higher-seeded team (number one being the highest), although since all games were played in the same location, this was merely a designated home court. Seeding was based on each team's regular season record within a conference; if two teams had the same record, standard tiebreaker rules were used. Conference seedings were ignored for the NBA Finals: Home court advantage went to the team with the better regular season record, and, if needed, ties were broken based on head-to-head record, followed by intra-conference record.\n\nPlayoff qualifying\nOn February 23, 2020, the Milwaukee Bucks became the first team to clinch a playoff spot. The Toronto Raptors, Los Angeles Lakers, and Boston Celtics subsequently clinched playoff berths before the season was suspended on March 11.\n\nEastern Conference\nWestern Conference\nBracket\nTeams in bold advanced to the next round.

All games were played behind closed doors at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Walt Disney World.\n\nEastern Conference first round\n(1) Milwaukee Bucks vs. (8) Orlando Magic\nMilwaukee was the first team in the league to refuse to play a game for social justice following the shooting of Jacob Blake.\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between the two teams, with the Bucks winning the first meeting.\n\n(2) Toronto Raptors vs. (7) Brooklyn Nets\nToronto set an NBA playoff record in Game 4 with 100 bench points in a single game.\n\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Nets winning the two previous meetings.\n\n(3) Boston Celtics vs. (6) Philadelphia 76ers\nThis was the 22nd playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Celtics winning 13 of the first 21 meetings.\n\n(4) Indiana Pacers vs. (5) Miami Heat\nThis was the fifth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Heat winning three of the first four meetings.\n\nWestern Conference first round\n(1) Los Angeles Lakers vs. (8) Portland Trail Blazers\nDespite a losing effort, LeBron James had the first 20-point, 15 rebound, 15 assist performance in NBA playoff history.\n\nThis was the Lakers first playoff series win since 2012.\nGame 5 was postponed by the league after the Lakers and Trail Blazers refused to play.\n\nThis was the 12th playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning nine of the first eleven meetings.\n\n(2) Los Angeles Clippers vs. (7) Dallas Mavericks\nDončić's 42 points are the most points in a playoff debut. Following the game, many people, including LeBron James and current Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, criticized the officials for controversially ejecting Porziņģis during the 3rd quarter after he received two technical fouls that the critics considered \"bogus\".\n\nDown by 1, Luka Dončić hit the game-winning 3 point buzzer-beater at the end of overtime. He becomes the youngest player to hit a buzzer-beater in the playoffs. His winning shot capped an incredible triple-double performance with 43 points, 17 rebounds, and 13 assists.\n\nThe Clippers set 5 franchise records in this game, including: most points scored in a playoff game, as well as most 3-pointers made in a playoff game, as they shot 22-of-35 from long range.\n\nKawhi Leonard became the first player since 2000 to have 30+ points, 10+ rebounds, 5+ assists and 5+ steals in a playoff game.\n\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Clippers and the Mavericks.\n\n(3) Denver Nuggets vs. (6) Utah Jazz\nMitchell's 57 points became the third most points scored in a single playoff game.\n\nThis was the first playoff game in NBA history in which two players scored 50 points.\n\nDenver became the 12th team in NBA history to come back from a 3–1 deficit. Nikola Jokić scored the go-ahead hook shot with 27.8 seconds remaining in regulation. Mike Conley Jr.'s potential series-winning three-pointer at the buzzer rimmed out.\n\nThis was the fifth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Jazz winning three of the first four meetings.\n\n(4) Houston Rockets vs. (5) Oklahoma City Thunder\nGame 5 was postponed by the league following a boycott by the Rockets and Thunder.\n\nThis was the ninth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Thunder/SuperSonics winning six of the first eight meetings.\n\nConference semifinals\nNote: All times are EDT (UTC−4) as listed by the NBA. All games were played behind closed doors at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Walt Disney World.\n\nEastern Conference semifinals\n(1) Milwaukee Bucks vs. (5) Miami Heat\nAfter being fouled by Giannis Antetokounmpo on a game-winning shot attempt as time expired in regulation, Jimmy Butler won the game for Miami with a pair of walk-off free throws. This marked the first time a playoff game had ended in such a fashion since Game 1 of the 1979 NBA Finals.\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Heat winning the previous meeting.\n\n(2) Toronto Raptors vs. (3) Boston Celtics\nBoth teams discussed a boycott of Game 1, similar to the Milwaukee Bucks, in protest due to the shooting of Jacob Blake. The game was eventually postponed.\n\nWith 0.5 seconds on the clock and Toronto trailing by 2, Kyle Lowry threw a cross-court inbounds pass to OG Anunoby, who made a 3-point shot as the buzzer sounded to win the game for Toronto.\n\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Raptors and the Celtics.\n\nWestern Conference semifinals\n(1) Los Angeles Lakers vs. (4) Houston Rockets\nThis was the ninth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning five of the first eight meetings.\n\n(2) Los Angeles Clippers vs. (3) Denver Nuggets\nThis was the first time that an NBA team overcame a 3–1 deficit twice in the same playoffs, and the first time an NBA franchise did so twice in the same decade.\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Clippers winning the previous meeting.\n\nConference finals\nNote: All times are EDT (UTC−4) as listed by the NBA. All games were played behind closed doors at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Walt Disney World.\n\nEastern Conference finals\n(3) Boston Celtics vs. (5) Miami Heat\nIn an unprecedented manner, Mark Jones and Doris Burke called Game 1 while Mike Breen, Jeff Van Gundy, and Mark Jackson, were in charge for Game 7 of the 2020 Western Conference Semifinals between the Los Angeles Clippers and the Denver Nuggets (see above). Starting with Game 2, Breen, Van Gundy, and Jackson took the remainder of the Conference Finals and the NBA Finals while Burke is assigned to ESPN Radio. Burke would have left the radio team when she was promoted to the lead team on television in 2023\n\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between the two teams, with the Heat winning two of the first three meetings.\n\nWestern Conference finals\n(1) Los Angeles Lakers vs. (3) Denver Nuggets\nAnthony Davis scored 31 points, including a 3-point shot over Nikola Jokić at the buzzer, to give the Lakers a 2–0 lead in the Western Conference finals.\n\nThis was the seventh playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning the first six meetings.\n\nNBA Finals: (W1) Los Angeles Lakers vs. (E5) Miami Heat\nNote: All times are EDT (UTC−4) as listed by the NBA.

    "2021 NBA playoffs": "The 2021 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 2020–21 season. With the COVID-19 pandemic impacting the NBA for the second consecutive year, the regular season was reduced to 72 games for each team and the start date of the playoffs was moved from its usual time in mid-April to May 22, 2021.

The first stage, the NBA play-in games, was a four-team playoff in each conference for the No. 7 to No. 10 seeds in each conference.  In this format, the No. 7 and No. 8 teams need to win one game to advance to the second stage, with a double chance, while the No. 9 and No. 10 teams need to win two games to advance, eliminated by just one loss.\n\nOverview\nNotable updates to postseason appearances\nThe Portland Trail Blazers entered their eighth consecutive postseason, which was the longest active streak in the NBA until their failure to qualify the following year.\nThe Boston Celtics entered their seventh consecutive postseason.\nBoth the Utah Jazz and Milwaukee Bucks entered their fifth consecutive postseason.\nMilwaukee also advanced to their first NBA Finals since 1974 and this was the Bucks' first Eastern Conference championship in franchise history as the team was in the Western Conference until 1980.\nThe Philadelphia 76ers entered their fourth consecutive postseason.\nThe Brooklyn Nets, Los Angeles Clippers, and Denver Nuggets all entered their third consecutive postseason.\nThe Miami Heat, Los Angeles Lakers, and Dallas Mavericks all entered their second consecutive postseason.\nThe Washington Wizards made their first postseason appearance since 2018.\nThe Atlanta Hawks (which entered their first Conference finals appearance since 2015) and Memphis Grizzlies made their first postseason appearance since 2017.\nThe New York Knicks made their first postseason appearance since 2013.\nThe Phoenix Suns made their first postseason appearance since 2010.\nPhoenix also won the Western Conference and advanced to their first NBA Finals since 1993.\nThe Houston Rockets missed the playoffs for the first time in nine years.\nThe Toronto Raptors missed the playoffs for the first time in eight years.\nBoth the Oklahoma City Thunder and Indiana Pacers missed the playoffs for the first time in six years.\nThe Orlando Magic missed the playoffs for the first time in three years.\nThe San Antonio Spurs returned to the postseason after missing the playoffs the previous year but were eliminated after losing to Memphis in the first stage of the Page–McIntyre system system tournament.\nThe Golden State Warriors returned to the postseason after missing the playoffs the previous year, being the first team to be eliminated from the Page–McIntyre system tournament with the double chance.

However, the Warriors franchise achieved the same deeds when the East and the West were called \"Divisions\", before they were realigned as \"Conferences\" in the 1970-71 expansion. Before 1970–71, the teams emerged from the East and West playoff brackets were called Eastern Division Champions and Western Division Champions, respectively. The Philadelphia Warriors won the Eastern Division in 1956, while the San Francisco Warriors won the Western Division in 1964 and 1967.

They also became the third team to win 4 consecutive games after being down 0–2. The last team to accomplish this feat is the 2006 Miami Heat.\nThe Milwaukee Bucks became the second team in NBA playoff history to overcome an 0–2 deficit twice in the same postseason (2021 Los Angeles Clippers).\nThe Milwaukee Bucks became the first team below the 2nd seed to win a championship since the Dallas Mavericks in 2011.\n\nFormat\nThe NBA Board of Governors approved a format for the 2020–21 season to have a play-in tournament involving the teams that ranked 7th through 10th in each conference. The 7th place team and 8th place team participate in the double-chance game, with the winner advancing to the playoffs as the 7-seed. The loser then plays the winner of the elimination game between the 9th place and 10th place teams to determine the playoff's 8-seed. The NBA's regular playoff format would then proceed as normal.\nUnder the NBA's regular playoff format, the eight teams with the most wins in each conference qualified for the playoffs. The seedings were based on each team's record. Each conference's bracket was fixed; there was no reseeding. All rounds were best-of-seven series; the series ended when one team won four games, and that team advanced to the next round. All rounds, including the NBA Finals, were in a 2–2–1–1–1 format. In the conference playoffs, home court advantage went to the higher-seeded team (number one being the highest). Seeding was based on each team's regular season record within a conference; if two teams had the same record, standard tiebreaker rules were used. Conference seedings were ignored for the NBA Finals: Home court advantage went to the team with the better regular season record, and, if needed, ties were broken based on head-to-head record, followed by intra-conference record.\n\nPlayoff qualifying\nOn April 25, 2021, the Utah Jazz became the first team to clinch a playoff spot. While noted in the below tables, division titles have no bearing on seeding.\n\nEastern Conference\nIndiana (34–38) and Charlotte (33–39) also secured play-in berths but did not advance to the playoffs.\n\nWestern Conference\nGolden State (39–33) and San Antonio (33–39) also secured play-in berths but did not advance to the playoffs.\n\nPlay-in tournament brackets\nEastern Conference\nBold Game winner\nItalic Team with home-court advantage\n\nWestern Conference\nBold Game winner\nItalic Team with home-court advantage\n\nBracket\nTeams in bold advanced to the next round. The numbers to the left of each team indicate the team's seeding in its conference, and the numbers to the right indicate the number of games the team won in that round. The division champions are marked by an asterisk. Teams with home court advantage, the higher seeded team, are shown in italics.\n\nFirst round\nNote: Times are EDT (UTC−4) as listed by the NBA. If the venue is located in a different time zone, the local time is also given.\n\nEastern Conference first round\n(1) Philadelphia 76ers vs. (8) Washington Wizards\nThis was the sixth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the 76ers winning three of the first five meetings.\n\n(2) Brooklyn Nets vs. (7) Boston Celtics\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, but the first since the New Jersey Nets relocated to Brooklyn and became the Brooklyn Nets in 2012, with the Nets winning the first two meetings.\n\n(3) Milwaukee Bucks vs. (6) Miami Heat\nThe Bucks struggled offensively against Miami, shooting only 16% (5–31) on three-point shots. The game went into overtime thanks to a game-tying, buzzer-beating layup by Jimmy Butler, but Milwaukee was able to pull away and win on a Khris Middleton jump shot, made with only 0.5 seconds left.\n\nThe Bucks erupted for 46 points in the first quarter, setting a new franchise playoff record, en route to a dominating 132–98 victory. The Bucks would make 22 three-pointers, after making only 5 in game 1.\n\nThe Bucks would cruise to another convincing victory in game 3, to take a commanding 3–0 series lead on Miami. In games 2 & 3, the Heat led for only 17 seconds, out of 96 minutes of game time.\n\nThough Miami built a 7-point lead at halftime, the Bucks went on a 24–6 run in the third quarter to take a lead they would not relinquish, leading to a four-game sweep of the Heat.\n\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Heat winning the first two meetings.\n\n(4) New York Knicks vs. (5) Atlanta Hawks\nIn Game 1, Trae Young hits the game-winning floater with 0.9 seconds left.\n\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Knicks winning the first two meetings.\n\nWestern Conference first round\n(1) Utah Jazz vs. (8) Memphis Grizzlies\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the Jazz and the Grizzlies.\n\n(2) Phoenix Suns vs. (7) Los Angeles Lakers\nThis was the 13th playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning eight of the first 12 meetings.\n\n(3) Denver Nuggets vs. (6) Portland Trail Blazers\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with Portland winning two of the first three meetings.\n\n(4) Los Angeles Clippers vs. (5) Dallas Mavericks\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Clippers winning the first meeting.\n\nConference semifinals\nNote: Times are EDT (UTC−4) as listed by the NBA. If the venue is located in a different time zone, the local time is also given.\n\nEastern Conference semifinals\nThis was the first time both Conference semifinals went seven games since 2001.\n\n(1) Philadelphia 76ers vs. (5) Atlanta Hawks\nThe Atlanta Hawks dominated during the early part of the game, leading by as much as 26 points. However, the 76ers performed a major rally, eventually cutting the deficit to just 3 points with a minute left in regulation. 20 seconds later, Bogdan Bogdanovic hit a clutch 3, but the 76ers would make it a 3-point game again with 28.7 seconds left. Joel Embiid then committed a clear path foul, giving Atlanta 2 free throws and possession of the ball. The Hawks sealed the game with Trae Young's alley-oop assist to John Collins.\nTrae Young secured a double-double with 35 points and 10 assists for The Hawks.  Joel Embiid scored 39 points for the 76ers.After the 76ers started the game up 20–4 with 6 minutes left in the 1st quarter, the Hawks rallied and the game remained close until the start of the 4th quarter, in which the 76ers blew the game open with a 14–0 run, resulting in the series being tied at a game apiece.\nJoel Embiid secured a double-double with 40 points and 13 rebounds, while Danny Green had 8 assists.  Trae Young also scored a double-double with 21 points and 11 assists while John Collins grabbed 10 rebounds.The 76ers cruised their way to victory throughout the entire game thanks in part to Joel Embiid's 27 points, 9 rebounds, and 8 assists.\nTrae Young scored 28 points and 8 assists in the losing effort for the Hawks.Despite being down by 18, the Atlanta Hawks staged a comeback, eventually taking their first lead since the 1st quarter at the start of the 4th quarter. The 76ers were up by 4 with 2:20 left in the 4th quarter, but the Hawks responded with a 7–0 run, leading by 3 with 49.6 seconds left. After Embiid got fouled and made both free throws to make it 101–100, and a turnover by John Collins, the 76ers had a chance at leading the series 3 games to 1. Embiid's go-ahead shot fell short and the ball went out of bounds, last touched by Ben Simmons, giving Atlanta the ball with 8.2 seconds left.\nAfter Trae Young made both of his free throws to make it a 3-point game, the 76ers had 6.6 seconds left to tie it, but Seth Curry's game-tying 3-pointer was no good, giving Atlanta the comeback victory.In the pivotal Game 5, the 76ers appeared to be on their way to victory, leading by as much as 26 points and with a 99.7% win probability according to ESPN.  However, the Hawks, who came back from down 18 in the previous game, performed one of the most memorable comebacks in NBA Playoffs history.  The Sixers were still up 104–94 with 4 minutes left in the game, only for the Hawks to respond with a 13–0 run to take a 3-point lead with 50 seconds left, their first lead of the entire game.\nWith 12 seconds left, a blocking foul by Danilo Gallinari sent Joel Embiid to the line with the Hawks leading by 3. He missed both free throws and Atlanta then had possession of the ball.  Trae Young sealed it with 2 clutch free throws, and Seth Curry then made a meaningless basket to make the final score 109–106 in favor the Hawks, who were now one game away from their first conference finals berth since 2015.  Once the final buzzer sounded, the 76ers' faithful booed their entire team off the floor due to the collapse.\nTrae Young led the Hawks' comeback victory with 39 points and 7 assists.\n\nThe Hawks became the 6th team in NBA Playoffs history to win a playoff game after trailing by 18+ points entering the 4th quarter in the shot clock era.With the Hawks looking to advance to the Eastern Conference finals on their home floor, they led by as much as 12 points during the 2nd quarter.  But the 76ers, who were trying to stave off elimination after back-to-back collapses, managed to take control of the game.\nHowever, the game once again would go down to the wire, as the Sixers were up 94–87 with 3 minutes left. The Hawks responded with 2 three-pointers from Gallinari and Young, who cut the deficit to one with 1:59 left in the 4th quarter.  The lights at State Farm Arena went out, causing a one-minute delay. Once the lights came back on, Philadelphia immediately responded by preserving the lead as Tobias Harris would make 2 game-sealing free throws to send the series back to Philadelphia for Game 7 on Sunday night.In front of a loud Wells Fargo Center, Game 7 was a deadlocked affair, with neither team able to gain a double-digit lead. The game and the serie once again came down to the wire. With 1:12 left in the 4th quarter, the Hawks were leading, 93–92, and had the ball. Kevin Huerter attempted a 3-point shot that missed, but was fouled by Matisse Thybulle, sending him to the line where he made 3 free throws. On the next possession, Danilo Gallinari stripped Joel Embiid of the ball and then dunked to make it 98–92 in favor of the Hawks, who from that point on had complete control of the game. The Atlanta Hawks upset the top-seeded 76ers to advance to the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in 6 years.\nKevin Huerter was the Hawks' top scorer with 27 points, John Collins grabbed 16 rebounds and Trae Young had 10 assists.\nFor the Sixers, Joel Embiid scored 31 points, while Tobias Harris grabbed 14 rebounds.\nBen Simmons' Game 7 performance was criticized as he scored only 5 points with 13 assists. With 3:30 left in the 4th quarter and the Sixers down 2, Simmons passed up a wide open dunk and instead passed to Matisse Thybulle, who got fouled and split the free throws. Sixers' coach Doc Rivers was asked in his post-game conference if Simmons could be the point guard of a championship team, with Rivers responding \"I don't know the answer to that right now\". Joel Embiid cited the decision as the turning point of the game.\nEventually it would be Ben Simmons, Andre Drummond & Seth Curry's last playoff game as a 76er, as all of them were traded to the Brooklyn Nets on February 10, 2022.\nIt was Atlanta's first win over Philadelphia in any sport playoff series since 1978.\n\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with the 76ers winning both previous meetings.\n\n(2) Brooklyn Nets vs. (3) Milwaukee Bucks\nGame 7 would go on to be an instant classic with both teams locked in for the entire game. In the final seconds of regulation, Kevin Durant appeared to have given the Nets a 1-point lead on a fadeaway three-point shot with 1 second left. Replay showed, however, that his foot was on the line. With the score tied at 109, Milwaukee had a chance to win the series, but Giannis Antetokounmpo's turnaround jump shot missed, sending the game into overtime. The Nets held a two-point lead until the final 90 seconds of overtime where the Bucks would score on back-to-back possessions to get on the board and take a 113–111 lead with 40 seconds remaining. The Nets had possession in the last 15 seconds of the game, with Durant shooting a similar turnaround game-tying, almost-three-point jump shot; however, it was an airball. The Bucks subsequently sealed the game on two free throws by Brook Lopez (a former Net), sending them to the Eastern Conference finals for the second time in three years. This marked the first game seven to go into overtime since 2006 involving the Dallas Mavericks and the San Antonio Spurs, which the Mavericks won and prevented the team from blowing a 3–1 lead to the Spurs. It was also the Bucks' first victory on the road in a postseason game seven, having gone 0–7 in previous playoff road game seven's. It also became the seventh team in NBA playoff history and the first since the 2017–18 Cleveland Cavaliers that a road team won game seven in the postseason also joined by other teams the 1968–69 Boston Celtics (who upset the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1969 series.), 1970–71 Baltimore Bullets (who were swept by eventual champions Bucks in the 1971 series.), the 2006–07 Utah Jazz, 2007–08 San Antonio Spurs, the 2015-16 Cleveland Cavaliers  and the 2017–18 Cleveland Cavaliers, and followed by 2021–22 Dallas Mavericks, and also the third team in NBA playoff history to win game seven on the road in overtime joined the 2001–02 Los Angeles Lakers, and the 2005–06 Mavericks' team.\n\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, but the first since the New Jersey Nets relocated to Brooklyn and became the Brooklyn Nets in 2012, with the Bucks winning two of the first three meetings.\n\nWestern Conference semifinals\n(1) Utah Jazz vs. (4) Los Angeles Clippers\nThe Clippers were trailing by 22 at the end of the first half in Game 6. They went down 25 at the start of the third quarter, before a retaliation led by Terance Mann allowed the Clippers to fight back to within 3 points at the end of the third quarter. In the fourth, the momentum from the third quarter and Utah's struggles allowed the Clippers to complete the comeback, becoming the first team to recover from being down 0–2 twice in the same playoffs, and reaching their first Conference finals in franchise history.\n\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Jazz winning the previous three meetings.\n\n(2) Phoenix Suns vs. (3) Denver Nuggets\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with Phoenix winning two of the first three meetings.\n\nConference finals\nNote: Times are EDT (UTC−4) as listed by the NBA. If the venue is located in a different time zone, the local time is also given.\n\nEastern Conference finals\n(3) Milwaukee Bucks vs. (5) Atlanta Hawks\nAtlanta's top offensive star, Trae Young, scored 48 points in his conference finals debut, while the Hawks rallied in the 2nd half to beat the Bucks in game 1 in Milwaukee, aided by 5 offensive rebounds in the final 2 minutes.\n\nThe Bucks rode a 20–0 scoring run in the 2nd quarter to run away with a game 2 victory.\n\nTrailing by 2 points going into the 4th quarter, the Bucks' Khris Middleton would carry Milwaukee to victory in game 3, outscoring Atlanta in the final quarter by himself, 20–17, en route to a game-high 38 points, putting the Bucks back in the lead in the series and getting back homecourt advantage. Atlanta's loss was also compounded when Trae Young suffered a bruised foot when he rolled his ankle over a referee's foot, leaving his status for the rest of the series in doubt.\n\nThe Bucks' 3-point woes returned in game 4, as the team only shot 21% (8–39) in a loss to Atlanta that evened the series once more. Even worse, the Bucks' superstar, Giannis Antetokounmpo, hyperextended his knee while trying to defend an alley-oop dunk, though an MRI the following day revealed no structural damage, and Antetokounmpo potentially available for either game 7 or the NBA Finals.\n\nWith both teams' stars out with injuries, both the Hawks and Bucks needed contributions from their other players in game 5. The Bucks would deliver, led by Brook Lopez's 33 points. In addition to Lopez, 3 other Bucks starters (Khris Middleton, Jrue Holiday, and Bobby Portis) scored at least 20 points. While Atlanta kept the game close, aided by Bogdan Bogdanovic's 28 points, the Bucks took a 3–2 series lead, leaving them one win away from the Eastern Conference championship.\n\nFacing elimination, the Hawks got Trae Young back to start game 6, but he still struggled with his injured foot, scoring only 14 points. After leading Atlanta by only 4 points at halftime, Khris Middleton would score the Bucks' first 16 points of the 3rd quarter to build a 19-point lead going into the 4th quarter. The Bucks would weather a wave of hot shooting from Bogdan Bogdanovic and Cam Reddish, helped by a crucial 3-point shot by PJ Tucker, and an alley-oop dunk by Brook Lopez that essentially clinched the game and the series for the Bucks. The victory gave the Bucks the Eastern Conference championship, their 3rd overall conference title (though the previous two were for the Western Conference), and their first trip to the NBA Finals since 1974.\nGame 6 was also the final game announced by famed basketball broadcaster Marv Albert.\n\nThis was the fifth playoff meeting between these two teams, with each team winning two series apiece. Four months later, two teams from Milwaukee and Atlanta would meet again in a sports postseason as the Braves beat the Brewers in the 2021 NLDS.\n\nWestern Conference finals\n(2) Phoenix Suns vs. (4) Los Angeles Clippers\nDeandre Ayton dunked in the game-winning alley-oop off the inbound pass from Jae Crowder with 0.7 seconds remaining.\n\nThe Clippers shot 0 of 12 in the fourth quarter on shots that could have tied the game or taken the lead. That is the most such attempts without a make in the fourth quarter of a game over the last 25 postseasons. During the last 8 seconds of the game when the Clippers trailed by 1 point, there was a controversial call where Nicolas Batum of the Clippers deflected the ball off the finger tips of Cameron Payne of the Suns, but the ball was given to the Suns. There was no review of the play despite a heavy plea from the Clippers.\n\nChris Paul's 41 points matched his career high with that of his performance as a member of the Houston Rockets in Game 5 against the Utah Jazz in 2018, both of which were series clinchers. Paul previously played for the Clippers from 2011 to 2017. Patrick Beverley shoved Paul during a timeout, which led to an ejection, a flagrant foul, a technical foul and being suspended by the league president, former All-Star player and former head coach Kiki VanDeWeghe and current league commissioner Adam Silver for the first game of the 2021–22 season. This turned out to be the last game of Beverley's career with the Clippers before being traded away twice to the Memphis Grizzlies and the Minnesota Timberwolves. Beverley became the first player to be suspended for first game of the following season since Andrew Bynum in the 2011 NBA playoffs, for shoving and elbowing J. J. Barea during the Los Angeles Lakers' eventual four–game sweep by the eventual NBA champions, the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Suns winning the previous meeting.\n\nNBA Finals: (W2) Phoenix Suns vs. (E3) Milwaukee Bucks\nNote: Times are EDT (UTC−4) as listed by the NBA. If the venue is located in a different time zone, the local time is also given.\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Bucks winning the first meeting.\n\nStatistical leaders\nNotable fan incidents\nThroughout the playoffs, there were a number of incidents at multiple games involving fans:\n\nMay 26: A fan spat at Trae Young during Game 2 of the Hawks–Knicks series at Madison Square Garden in New York City.\nMay 26: A fan dumped popcorn on Russell Westbrook during Game 2 of the Wizards–76ers series at Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia.\nMay 26: Three fans were verbally disruptive towards the family of Ja Morant during Game 2 of the Grizzlies–Jazz series at Vivint Arena in Salt Lake City. There were also insensitive remarks made towards the family of Dillon Brooks.\nMay 30: A fan threw a water bottle at Kyrie Irving following Game 4 of the Nets–Celtics series at TD Garden in Boston after the game.\nMay 31: A fan ran onto the court during Game 4 of the 76ers–Wizards series at Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C.\nJune 20: A fan threw a can onto the court in the closing seconds of Game 7 of the Hawks–76ers series in Philadelphia.\n\nMedia coverage\nTelevision\nESPN, ABC, TNT, and NBA TV broadcast the playoffs nationally in the United States. During the first two rounds, games were split by ESPN, ABC, and TNT. TNT primarily aired games on Saturday through Wednesday while ESPN does so on Friday and Saturday. For Thursday games, TNT had them in the first round and ESPN in the second round. ABC then aired selected games in the first two rounds on Friday through Sunday. NBA TV also televised selected games in the first round on Tuesday through Thursday. Regional sports networks affiliated with teams also broadcast the games, except for weekend games televised on ABC. ESPN/ABC had exclusive coverage of the Western Conference finals while TNT had exclusive coverage of the Eastern Conference finals. ABC had exclusive coverage of the NBA Finals for the 19th straight year.\nThis was the final postseason for Marv Albert, who announced his retirement on May 17, 2021. Albert, who turned 80 in June, had spent most of the previous 31 years as the lead broadcaster for NBA coverage on TNT and NBC.\n\nNotes\nSee also\nNBA records\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nBasketball – Reference.com's 2021 Playoffs section",
    "2022 NBA playoffs": "The 2022 NBA playoffs was the postseason tournament of the National Basketball Association's 2021–22 season. The playoffs began on April 16 and ended on June 16 with the conclusion of the 2022 NBA Finals. The playoffs also returned to its normal April–June schedule for the first time since 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in two postponements in 2020 and 2021.\n\nOverview\nNotable updates to postseason appearances\nThe Phoenix Suns entered the postseason for the second consecutive season and also clinched the best record in the NBA for the first time since 2005.\nThe Miami Heat entered the postseason for the third consecutive season and also clinched the best record in the Eastern Conference for the first time since 2013.\nThe Boston Celtics entered the postseason for the eighth consecutive season, the longest such streak active in the NBA at the time.\nBoston also won the Eastern Conference and advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2010.\nThe Utah Jazz and Milwaukee Bucks entered the postseason for the sixth consecutive season.\nThe Philadelphia 76ers entered the postseason for the fifth consecutive season.\nThe Brooklyn Nets and Denver Nuggets entered the postseason for the fourth consecutive season.\nThe Dallas Mavericks entered the postseason for the third consecutive season.\nThe Memphis Grizzlies and Atlanta Hawks entered the postseason for the second consecutive season.\nThe Toronto Raptors entered the postseason for the first time since 2020.\nThe Golden State Warriors entered the postseason for the first time since 2019.\nGolden State also won the Western Conference and advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2019 and sixth time since 2015.\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves and New Orleans Pelicans entered the postseason for the first time since 2018.\nThe Chicago Bulls entered the postseason for the first time since 2017.\nThe Los Angeles Lakers missed the postseason for the first time in three years.\nThe Portland Trail Blazers missed the postseason for the first time in nine years.\nThe Sacramento Kings missed the postseason for the sixteenth consecutive season, surpassing the Los Angeles Clippers for the longest playoff drought in NBA history, beginning in 2007.\n\nNotable occurrences\nNeither Los Angeles team qualified for the playoffs. The last time this occurred was in 2018. (The Los Angeles Clippers made the play-in as the eighth seed but did not advance.)\nThis is the first time where both No. 8 seeds were eliminated in the Page-McIntyre stage by the No. 9 seeded teams.\nA team with a losing record in the Western Conference (Pelicans) qualified for the playoffs. This previously occurred in 2020.\nFor the first time in NBA playoff history, four players aged 22 or younger (Anthony Edwards, Ja Morant, Tyrese Maxey, and Jordan Poole) scored 30 or more points in a game in the same postseason.\nAnthony Edwards joined Derrick Rose, Tyler Herro, and Magic Johnson in scoring at least 35 points in a playoff game before turning 21.\nThe Utah Jazz became the fifth team in the last 10 postseasons to win a playoff game after trailing by 4-plus points in the final 40 seconds. Teams were 4–701 in that span prior to the game.\nThe Boston Celtics swept the Brooklyn Nets, marking the 46th year in a row that a sweep occurred. The last time a sweep did not occur was in 1976. This was the 182nd series sweep in NBA playoffs history.\nThe Philadelphia 76ers and Toronto Raptors series became the first Eastern Conference First Round series to go to a game 6 since 2018.\nThe Memphis Grizzlies became the first team ever to have multiple comebacks wins after trailing by double-digits going into the fourth quarter in a single playoff series.\nThe Dallas Mavericks won a playoff series for the first time since their championship run in 2011.\nChris Paul set a playoff record for most consecutive field goals made in a game without a miss, going 14-of-14 from the field.\nFor the first time since 2019, all top four teams in both the Eastern Conference and the Western Conference made it past the first round of the playoffs.\nFor the first time since 2011, no first-round matchup went to a game 7.\nWith a game 3 win at Denver, the Golden State Warriors have won a road game in 24 consecutive playoff series, beating the previous record set by the Miami Heat with 23. This record has since been extended to 27 consecutive playoff series with their road wins against Memphis, Dallas, and Boston.\nGame 1 between the Golden State Warriors and Memphis Grizzlies was the first game in playoff history where three players age 22 or younger (Ja Morant, Jaren Jackson Jr., and Jordan Poole) each had 30-plus points.\nJa Morant became the third player in league history to have multiple 45-point games in the postseason before turning 23, joining LeBron James and Kobe Bryant.\nThe Dallas Mavericks totaled nine assists against the Phoenix Suns in game 5, the lowest number of assists in a playoff game by a team since 2016.\nFor the first time since 2015, every Conference semifinals series went to a game 6.\nThe Mavericks–Suns series was the first of the 2022 playoffs to have a game 7, making it the 23rd consecutive NBA postseason to feature a game 7. The last time a game 7 did not occur in the playoffs was 1999. This was the 145th game 7 in NBA playoffs history.\nThe Golden State Warriors became the first team to grab 70-plus rebounds in a playoff game since 1983.\nWith the defending champion Milwaukee Bucks losing to the Boston Celtics, the 2022 playoffs was the third straight year where the defending champion was eliminated before the conference finals. After the Celtics defeated the Miami Heat, it was also the fifth straight year with a different EC champion.\nWith the defending Western Conference champion Phoenix Suns losing to the Dallas Mavericks, this marked the second straight year both of the NBA Finals participants from the previous year were eliminated before the conference finals.\nThe Dallas Mavericks made their first Conference finals since 2011.\nNeither the first-seeded team nor the second-seeded team made the Western Conference finals for the first time since 2011.\nIn game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals, the Miami Heat failed to get a shot for more than eight minutes, until 3:22 remained in the first quarter. This marked the longest a team has gone with no field goals to start a game in the postseason in 25 years. Subsequently, all starters for the Heat were outscored by a bench player (Victor Oladipo scored 23 points, more than 18 points from all of the starting five). The 18 points was the lowest number combined in a playoff game since starters were first tracked in 1971 and was also the first time in which a bench player outscores the entire starting lineup.\nBy advancing to the NBA Finals, the Golden State Warriors made their sixth Finals appearance in eight seasons, the first since 1990–98 Chicago Bulls (led by Michael Jordan) to have this feat.\nStephen Curry joined LeBron James and Michael Jordan as the only players in NBA Finals to score 40 or more points at age 34 or older.\nJayson Tatum set the all-time NBA record with 100 turnovers in a single postseason.\nBy beating the Celtics, the Warriors became the only team with a non-losing series record (1–1) against the Celtics in the Finals. The Celtics had winning series records in the Finals against the Lakers (9–3), the Hawks (3–1), the Rockets (2–0), the Bucks (1–0) and the Suns (1–0).\n\nFormat\nEight teams from each conference participated in the playoffs. The top six teams in each conference, based on winning percentage, directly qualified for the playoffs; the seeding order of those teams was also based on winning percentage. If two or more teams had the same record, standard NBA tiebreaker rules were used.\nThe NBA Board of Governors approved a format for the 2021–22 season to have a play-in tournament involving the teams ranked 7th through 10th in each conference. The 7th-place team and 8th-place team participated in a \"double-chance\" game, with the winner advancing to the playoffs as the 7-seed. The loser then played the winner of the elimination game between the 9th-place and 10th-place teams to determine the playoff's 8-seed. The NBA's regular playoff format then proceeded as normal.\nEach conference's bracket was fixed with no reseeding. All rounds were best-of-seven series; a series ended when one team won four games, and that team advanced to the next round. All rounds, including the NBA Finals, were in a 2–2–1–1–1 format with regards to hosting. In the conference playoffs, home court advantage went to the higher-seeded team (number one being the highest). Conference seedings were ignored for the NBA Finals: home court advantage went to the team with the better regular season record, and, if needed, ties were broken based on head-to-head record, followed by intra-conference record.\n\nPlayoff qualifying\nOn March 9, 2022, the Phoenix Suns became the first team to clinch a playoff spot. On April 5, the San Antonio Spurs and New Orleans Pelicans became the last two teams to qualify for postseason play, as both teams secured spots in the first-stage play-in tournament. On April 7, the Denver Nuggets became the final team to secure a direct berth in the playoff bracket, qualifying as the sixth seed in the Western Conference and relegating the Minnesota Timberwolves to the play-in tournament. While noted in the below tables, division titles have no bearing on seeding.\nSeeds 7 and 8 in each conference were determined via the first-stage play-in tournament, held April 12–15.\n\nEastern Conference\nCleveland (44–38) and Charlotte (43–39) also secured play-in berths but did not advance to the playoffs.\n\nWestern Conference\nThe L.A. Clippers (42–40) and San Antonio (34–48) also secured play-in berths but did not advance to the playoffs.\n\nPlay-in tournament brackets\nEastern Conference\nBold Game winner\nItalic Team with home-court advantage\n\nWestern Conference\nBold Game winner\nItalic Team with home-court advantage\n\nBracket\nTeams in bold advanced to the next round. The numbers to the left of each team indicate the team's seeding in its conference, and the numbers to the right indicate the number of games the team won in that round.

If the venue is located in a different time zone, the local time is also given.\n\nEastern Conference first round\n(1) Miami Heat vs. (8) Atlanta Hawks\nDuncan Robinson led the Heat in scoring with 27 points on 9-of-10 shooting, including going 8-of-9 from three-point range. On the other hand, Atlanta's Trae Young struggled, shooting just 1-of-12, finishing the game with eight points and six turnovers.\n Jimmy Butler scored a playoff career-high 45 points, shooting 15-of-25 as well as committing zero turnovers en route to securing a 2–0 series lead. Trae Young also rebounded in game 2, finishing the game with 25 points, but he committed a career-high 10 turnovers.\n In danger of going down 0–3 in the series, Trae Young hit a game-winning floater in the lane with 4.4 seconds left as the Hawks overcame a 16-point deficit in the second half.\n After losing Kyle Lowry in game 3 with a hamstring strain, the Heat dominated the Hawks down the stretch, outscoring Atlanta in the final three quarters 85–60. Jimmy Butler scored 13 of his 36 points in the second quarter along with 10 rebounds and four assists. Trae Young scored only nine points with five assists and five turnovers, as he was held to single digit points by Miami's defense for the second time in four games.\n Without Jimmy Butler and Kyle Lowry, the Heat were able to hold off the Hawks thanks to a 23-point performance from Victor Oladipo. De'Andre Hunter shined for Atlanta in the loss, scoring a career-high 35 points, as well as the most points scored by a Hawks player in the series.\n\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Hawks winning the first two meetings.\n\n(2) Boston Celtics vs. (7) Brooklyn Nets\nThe Celtics lost a 15-point third quarter lead but went on to win game 1 on Jayson Tatum's layup at the buzzer.\n The Nets had a 17-point lead late in the first half, but lost the game due to a huge fourth quarter by the Celtics. Kevin Durant notably struggled in the second half, going 0–10 from the floor and committing 4 turnovers as Boston outscored Brooklyn 59–42 in the final two quarters.\n Despite a stellar night from Bruce Brown, who had 26 points on 10-of-19 shooting from the field, the Nets were unable to overcome poor performances from Durant and Irving, who only scored 16 points apiece, as well as a 39-point explosion from Jayson Tatum who also had 6 steals. The Celtics led by as many as 15 in the final quarter before holding off the Nets to take a commanding 3–0 series lead.\n Despite Jayson Tatum fouling out late in the fourth quarter, the Celtics were able to hold off the Nets to complete the sweep. Kevin Durant had his best game of the series with 39 points, helping Brooklyn trim the deficit to 1 point with 3:29 to play in the fourth quarter, but thanks to Tatum's 29 points, Boston never trailed. Nic Claxton struggled at the free throw line, missing his first 10 attempts, and finishing 1-of-11. This was the eighth playoff sweep in Celtics' franchise history, as Boston swept its first-round series for the third time in four years. The Nets were the only team in this season's playoffs to get swept.\n\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, and the second since the New Jersey Nets relocated to Brooklyn in 2012, with the Nets winning the first three meetings.\n\n(3) Milwaukee Bucks vs. (6) Chicago Bulls\nDespite finishing the game with 21 turnovers and blowing a 16-point lead, the Bucks outlasted the Bulls 93–86. Giannis Antetokounmpo finished the game with 27 points and 16 rebounds. The Bulls struggled on offense, shooting a season-low 32.3% from the floor, with DeMar DeRozan and Zach LaVine shooting a combined 12-of-44 (27.3%).\n While the Bulls were leading by as much as 18 in the third quarter, they withstood two furious rallies in both the third and fourth quarters by the Bucks, with DeMar DeRozan scoring a playoff career-high 41 points. This was the Bulls' first playoff victory since game 2 of the 2017 Eastern Conference first round against the Boston Celtics. Two Bucks players suffered injuries during the game: Bobby Portis left mid-game after suffering a \"right eye abrasion\" and Khris Middleton suffered a sprained MCL in his left knee.\n Despite Chicago hosting their first playoff game in five years, Milwaukee dominated throughout the game. Grayson Allen came off the bench and led the Bucks in points with 22, along with Bobby Portis collecting 16 rebounds, tying a career high. The loss was also the largest playoff loss at home in Bulls history.\n Grayson Allen set playoff career highs with 27 points and six three-pointers, along with Giannis Antetokounmpo leading the team with 32 points and 17 rebounds as the Bucks cruised to a second straight win on the road. With the loss, the Bulls had been outscored by a combined 54 points over the past two games, both of which were at home.\n Despite being without Khris Middleton the last three games, Milwaukee won all three by an average margin of 23.3 points. DeMar DeRozan was scoreless in the first 26 minutes of the game and attempted just one shot in the first quarter, where Chicago was outscored 34–18. Giannis Antetokounmpo had 33 points and nine rebounds as the Bucks won their first-round matchup for the fourth consecutive season.\n\nThis was the fifth playoff meeting between these two teams, with each team winning two out of the first four meetings.\n\n(4) Philadelphia 76ers vs. (5) Toronto Raptors\nIn his first playoff game as a starter, Tyrese Maxey scored 38 points, with 21 of his 38 points coming in the third quarter. Raptors rookie Scottie Barnes had 15 points, 10 rebounds, and eight assists prior to exiting the game with an ankle injury.\n After the Raptors took a one-point lead into the second quarter, the 76ers dominated for the rest of the game. Philadelphia outscored Toronto 80–64 in the final three quarters, with Joel Embiid finishing the game with 31 points and 11 rebounds.\n With 0.9 seconds on the shot clock and 2.6 seconds remaining in overtime, Joel Embiid hit a game-winning three-point shot to secure a commanding 3–0 series lead after overcoming a 17-point deficit and never leading in regulation.\n Scottie Barnes made his return to the lineup for game 4 after missing the previous two games, leading the team with 11 rebounds. Raptors' Pascal Siakam scored 34 points while the 76ers' James Harden scored 22 points. In the second quarter, Fred VanVleet exited the game due to a hip injury and did not return. Despite this, the Raptors staved off elimination with a 110–102 win to send the series back to Philadelphia.\n Despite being without Fred VanVleet, the Raptors, with the help of Pascal Siakam's 23 points, 10 rebounds, and seven assists led almost the entire game and staved off elimination again to send the series back to Toronto for game 6. The 76ers had their own share of issues: while Joel Embiid scored 20 points with 11 rebounds, and James Harden had seven assists; the 76ers' bench scored only five points.\n The 76ers completed a 35-point rout of the Raptors to eliminate them from the playoffs. Joel Embiid had 33 points and 10 rebounds, and teammate Tyrese Maxey scored 25. The Raptors' Pascal Siakam scored 24 points in the loss, while Chris Boucher came off the bench and had 25 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with each team winning one series.\n\nWestern Conference first round\n(1) Phoenix Suns vs. (8) New Orleans Pelicans\nThe Pelicans started off slowly, but chipped away at a 23-point deficit to eventually trail 79–71 by the end of the third. However, Chris Paul took over late in the game by scoring 19 of his 30 points in the fourth quarter.\n After scoring 31 points in the first half, Devin Booker left the game in the third quarter after suffering a \"mild hamstring strain\" and did not return to the game. Meanwhile, Brandon Ingram finished the game with 37 points, 11 rebounds, and nine assists, leading the Pelicans to their first playoff win since 2018.\n Without Devin Booker, the Suns outlasted the Pelicans on the road, with Chris Paul and Deandre Ayton combining for 56 points. Paul scored 15 of Phoenix's first 23 points of the final quarter, along with committing zero turnovers, his second straight game doing so.\n Brandon Ingram scored 16 of his 30 points in the third quarter, his third straight game with 30-plus points. Jonas Valančiūnas also contributed with 26 points and 15 rebounds, along with scoring ten points in a 3:34 span in the fourth quarter to help the Pelicans pull away. Chris Paul struggled for the Suns, scoring just four points and three turnovers after previously having just two turnovers in the first three games.\n With the series back in Phoenix, Mikal Bridges helped the Suns take a 3–2 series lead thanks to a playoff career-high 31 points and four blocks, all while playing 47 minutes in the game. Chris Paul rebounded in game 5 as well, tallying 22 points and 11 assists. Phoenix never trailed in the game.\n In Devin Booker's return from the hamstring injury that had kept him out the previous three games, Chris Paul scored 33 points on a perfect 14-for-14 from the field (including one three-pointer) and 4-for-4 from the free throw line as the Suns advanced. Paul's 14-for-14 shooting set a record for most field goals made in a playoff game without a miss, and the first player to make 13-plus shots in a playoff game without a miss.\n\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the two teams.\n\n(2) Memphis Grizzlies vs. (7) Minnesota Timberwolves\nIn his playoff debut, Anthony Edwards led the Timberwolves in scoring with 36, joining Derrick Rose, Tyler Herro, and Magic Johnson in scoring at least 35 points in a playoff game before turning 21. The win was also the Timberwolves' first playoff opener they have won since 2004.\n Ja Morant and the Grizzlies rebounded in game 2, with Morant being one rebound shy of his first career playoff triple-double. The win was also the widest margin of victory in the Grizzlies' playoff history.\n Despite trailing by 25-plus points on two occasions, the Grizzlies battled back late in the game, including going on a 42–12 run in the final 13 minutes of the game to secure their first lead of the series. Ja Morant also became the first player in the Grizzlies' playoff history to record a triple-double.\n Karl-Anthony Towns and the Timberwolves were able to rebound after their game 3 collapse, with Towns putting up a career playoff-best 33 points and 14 rebounds. Desmond Bane also had a career night, hitting eight three-pointers and leading the Grizzlies with 34 points, tying a career high.\n After the Grizzlies erased a 13-point fourth-quarter lead by the Timberwolves, the game would come down to the wire from that point on. At the eight-second mark, Ja Morant would make two clutch free throws. After Minnesota used their last timeout, Anthony Edwards would hit a clutch three-pointer to tie the game at 109 with 3.7 seconds left. After Memphis called a timeout, Morant hit a game-winning layup with one second left. This was the Grizzlies' second double-digit comeback victory of the series.\n The Grizzlies' rallied from a double-digit deficit entering the fourth quarter for the third time in the series, winning their opening playoff series for the first time in seven years. Desmond Bane and Dillon Brooks each scored 23 points, with Bane going 27-of-56 on three-pointers in the series.\n\nThis was the first playoff meeting between the two teams.\n\n(3) Golden State Warriors vs. (6) Denver Nuggets\nIn his playoff debut, Jordan Poole led the Warriors in points with 30, shooting 9-of-13. Stephen Curry also came off the bench to contribute 16 points in 21 minutes after missing exactly a month with a sprained ligament in his left foot. This was also the Warriors' first playoff win since game 5 of the 2019 NBA Finals. Also, the city of San Francisco hosted a playoff game for the first time since 1964.\n Stephen Curry came off the bench for a second straight game, dropping 34 points in 23 minutes to lead the Warriors to a 2–0 advantage in the series. Nikola Jokić also led the Nuggets with 26 points and 11 rebounds before being ejected with seven minutes left in the game.\n The Warriors finished the game on a 9–2 run to hand the Nuggets their seventh consecutive loss in the playoffs. Stephen Curry and Jordan Poole combined for 54 points, along with Klay Thompson shooting six three-pointers en route to a 3–0 series lead.\n The Nuggets finished the game on a 9–5 run, snapping their seven-game losing streak in the playoffs, dating back to the 2021 postseason. Nikola Jokić led all scorers with 37 points and assisted on a Will Barton three-pointer from the left corner with 8.3 seconds left, effectively putting the game away.\n The Warriors advanced to the Western Conference semifinals for the first time since the 2019 NBA playoffs. Stephen Curry scored 20 points in the second half, leading the Warriors with 30 points. Gary Payton II also scored 10 of his 15 points in the fourth quarter. Nikola Jokić scored 12 of his 30 points in the final 3:46 of the fourth quarter, finishing the game with 19 rebounds and eight assists as the Nuggets lost their eighth game in their last nine playoff games.\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between the two teams, with the Warriors winning the first meeting.\n\n(4) Dallas Mavericks vs. (5) Utah Jazz\nScoring just two points in the first half, Donovan Mitchell erupted in the second half with 30 points, leading the Jazz to a game 1 win on the road. This was also the first time the Mavericks started the playoffs at home since their championship run in 2011.\n Down 0–1 in the series and without their star Luka Dončić, the Mavericks won due to a career-high 41 points from Jalen Brunson, along with the franchise record of fewest turnovers ever in a postseason game, with 3.\n Despite Donovan Mitchell putting up 28 points in the second half, the Mavericks took their first lead of the series, with the Dallas bench outscoring the Utah bench 49–24. The Jazz had previously won 11 straight against the Mavericks at home coming into the game.\n Luka Dončić made his return after missing the first three games of the series due to a \"calf strain\" and scored a double-double with 30 points, 10 rebounds, and 4 assists. Despite this, however, the game came down to the wire. With 30 seconds left in the game with the Mavericks up one, Dwight Powell was fouled but missed 2 crucial free throws, then Donovan Mitchell lobbed the ball to Rudy Gobert for an alley-oop, giving the Jazz the lead with 11 seconds to go. Dallas had one more shot, but Doncic's  potential game-winning three-pointer fell short as Utah tied the series 2-all. The Jazz also became the fifth team since 2013 to win after trailing by four-plus points in the final 40 seconds. Teams were 4–701 in that span coming into the game.\n After the first four games were decided by eight points or less, the Mavericks routed the Jazz at home 102–77 to regain the series lead. Luka Dončić once again led the Mavericks in points (33), rebounds (13), and assists (5) for the second straight game. Donovan Mitchell, who averaged 30 points in the first four games, scored just nine and missed all seven of his three-pointers before leaving with a left hamstring injury in the fourth quarter.\n Though the Jazz had a 12-point lead at halftime, the Mavericks stormed back to take the lead in the final few minutes. Rudy Gobert made a layup with 35 seconds to go to reduce the deficit to just one point. However, after a Mike Conley turnover, Jalen Brunson doubled the Mavericks' lead by scoring a free throw at 4.3 seconds. Bojan Bogdanović then missed a game-winning three-pointer with 1.9 seconds left on the clock to hand the Mavericks their first series win since their championship run in 2011. Donovan Mitchell recovered from the injury he sustained in the previous game, and had 23 points, eight rebounds, and nine assists. Brunson and Luka Dončić each scored 24 points for Dallas, and Spencer Dinwiddie scored 19 points.\n\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Mavericks winning the first two meetings.\n\nConference semifinals\nNote: Times are EDT (UTC−4) as listed by the NBA. If the venue is located in a different time zone, the local time is also given.\n\nEastern Conference semifinals\n(1) Miami Heat vs. (4) Philadelphia 76ers\nWithout Joel Embiid, who suffered an orbital fracture and concussion in the final minutes of game 6 against Toronto, the 76ers were unable to overcome missing their star player, with Philadelphia shooting 17.6% from beyond the arc, their second-worst percentage of the season. Tyler Herro scored 25 points—the second most he has ever had in a playoff game—while Bam Adebayo finished with 24 points and 12 rebounds as the top-seeded Heat outscored the 76ers 56–41 in the second half.\n The 76ers were unable to rally without their star Joel Embiid for the second straight game, with four Heat players scoring 18-plus points (Adebayo, Butler, Herro and Oladipo), along with shooting 48.3% from the three-point line. Tyrese Maxey led the way for Philadelphia with 34 points, but a 10–0 run in the fourth turned an eight-point Miami lead into an 18-point advantage, sealing the win.\n Although listed as \"doubtful\" leading into the game, Joel Embiid made his first appearance of the series, leading the 76ers to their first win with 18 points and 11 rebounds. Danny Green rebounded from a poor shooting performance in game 2 (shooting 1-for-10), making 6-of-7 three-pointers through the first three quarters. Kyle Lowry also returned from injury, but finished the game scoreless, with Jimmy Butler being the only Heat player to score more than 14 points in the game.\n After being held for under 30 points in 13 consecutive playoff games, James Harden broke through with 31 points to help Philadelphia tie the series. Joel Embiid once again contributed with 24 points and 11 rebounds as the 76ers shot 48.5% from the three-point line. Jimmy Butler also scored 40 points on 13-of-20 shooting from the floor, but the Heat, who shot 38% on three-pointers during the season, shot just 7-of-35 (20%) from beyond the arc.\n The Heat outscored the 76ers by 35 points, tying the second-widest margin of victory in Heat playoff history and tying the widest margin of victory of the 2022 NBA playoffs at the time of the game. Seven players for the Heat scored in double-digits, with Jimmy Butler scoring 23 points and Max Strus with 19 points and 10 rebounds. None of Philadelphia's starters played in the final 8:18 of the game, as the Heat outscored the 76ers 39–19 in the fourth quarter.\n Jimmy Butler scored 32 points and led the Heat to the conference finals for the second time in three seasons, with Butler scoring 14 points on 6-of-9 shooting in the third quarter where the Heat used a 16–2 run to take control. Joel Embiid scored 20 points with 12 rebounds on 7-of-24 shooting, but teammate James Harden failed to score in the second half, scoring all 11 of his points in the first half. The loss marked the fourth time in the last five years the 76ers had lost in the conference semifinals, having last reached the conference finals in 2001.\n\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with each team winning one previous series.\n\n(2) Boston Celtics vs. (3) Milwaukee Bucks\nThe Bucks won their fourth consecutive playoff game thanks to Giannis Antetokounmpo's second career playoff triple-double, along with Jrue Holiday leading the team with 25 points and 10 rebounds. Jayson Tatum scored 21 and Jaylen Brown had 12 points, but combined to shoot 10-for-31 in the game.\n Despite being without Marcus Smart, the Defensive Player of the Year, the Celtics held the Bucks to just 86 points, with Milwaukee shooting 16.7% from the three-point line. Jaylen Brown rebounded in game 2, scoring 25 of his 30 points in the first half, including 5-for-5 from the three-point line.\n Boston trailed by as much as 14 late in the third quarter and was facing a 13-point deficit with less than 10 minutes left before storming back. The Celtics pulled ahead 100–99 on Jaylen Brown's two free throws with 1:49 remaining. However, after Giannis Antetokounmpo made a go-ahead basket with 44.3 seconds left, Marcus Smart was fouled just before attempting a potential tying three-pointer with 4.6 seconds left. After making the first free throw, Smart missed the second intentionally and got his own rebound, but missed his putback attempt. After a brief scramble, Al Horford got the rebound and banked it in, but his final shot came just after the buzzer sounded, giving Milwaukee the win.\n The Celtics tied the series thanks to Al Horford and Jayson Tatum scoring 30 points apiece. Horford had 16 points and Tatum 12 in the fourth quarter alone to help the Celtics outscore the defending NBA champions at home 43–28. Giannis Antetokounmpo led the way for the Bucks with 34 points and 18 rebounds, but Jrue Holiday notably struggled from the field, shooting 5-for-22 (22.7%) as the Bucks shot 41.5% from the field as a team.\n With Boston looking to go up 3–2 in the series and leading by as much as 14 by the start of the fourth quarter, Milwaukee mounted a furious comeback in the final minutes. Down by 6 with 1:45 left in the game, both Giannis Antetokounmpo and Jrue Holiday each hit three-pointers to tie the game at 105. After Jayson Tatum was fouled and made both free throws with 31 seconds left, Antetokounmpo would also be fouled, making the first but missing the second. However, Bobby Portis secured the rebound and scored with 11.4 left, while Marcus Smart's potentially go-ahead shot was blocked by Holiday, who then converted two free throws to make it a three-point game with 5.9 left. Smart would be stripped of the ball by Holiday again at midcourt, completing the Bucks' comeback victory.\n Looking to move on from their loss in game 5 and looking to avoid elimination on the road, the Celtics were able to control the game, leading by as much as 18. Once again, however, the Bucks tried to mount another rally, cutting the deficit to four, but the Celtics were able to respond and force a game 7 in Boston. Jayson Tatum led the way with 46 points, nine rebounds and four assists, while Al Horford recorded 10 rebounds and four blocks for the Celtics. Giannis Antetokounmpo also had a big performance in the Bucks' loss, scoring 44 points, six assists, and 20 rebounds—the first 40–20 playoff game since Shaquille O'Neal achieved it in game 1 of the 2001 NBA Finals.\n The Bucks controlled most of the first quarter, leading by as much as 10, but the Celtics would storm back to lead by five points at halftime. Then, the Celtics took over the game from that point on as they beat the defending champions by 28 points. Grant Williams scored a career-high 27 points, including seven three-pointers while Jayson Tatum scored 23 points, Al Horford grabbed 10 rebounds, Celtics bench player Payton Pritchard scored 14 points, including four three-pointers, and Marcus Smart had 10 assists. As a team, the Celtics connected on a game 7 record 22 made three-pointers.\nDespite the Bucks' loss, Giannis Antetokounmpo secured a double-double with 25 points, 20 rebounds, and 9 assists, barely missing out on a triple-double. The Bucks missed 24 of their last 25 attempts from three-point range and finished the game 4-of-33 from beyond the arc in game 7, which is the second-worst three-point percentage in a playoff game ever with 30-plus attempts. Antetokounmpo would become the first player with 200 points, 100 rebounds, and 50 assists in a playoff series.\n\nThis was the eighth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Celtics winning five of the first seven meetings.\n\nWestern Conference semifinals\n(1) Phoenix Suns vs. (4) Dallas Mavericks\nAfter jumping to a 9–0 lead in the opening minutes, the Suns never trailed in the game as they beat the Mavericks for the 10th straight time, dating back to 2019. All five Suns starters scored in double figures, with Deandre Ayton leading the way with 25 points. Luka Dončić led the Mavericks with 45 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists, but no other Mavericks starter scored more than 15 points.\n Leading 89–83 entering the fourth quarter, the Suns exploded on offense, shooting 84% from the field (16-of-19) and outscoring Dallas 40–26. Chris Paul and Devin Booker combined for 58 points, with Paul scoring 14 of his 28 in the fourth quarter, as the Suns shot a franchise playoff-record 64.5% from the field. Luka Dončić scored 35 points, but only one other starter for the Mavericks scored more than 9 points.\n After struggling in the first two games of the series, Jalen Brunson scored 28 points and helped the Mavericks snap an 11-game losing streak against the Suns. Luka Dončić also had 26 points to go with 13 rebounds and nine assists, one assist shy of his fourth-career playoff triple-double. For the Suns, Chris Paul struggled on his 37th birthday, committing seven turnovers in the first half, the most turnovers Paul's ever had in any half in his career.\n The Mavericks tied the series thanks to a playoff career high from Dorian Finney-Smith, who scored 24 points on 8-of-12 from three-point range. Dallas matched its 20 three-pointers (20-of-44) from a similar Mother's Day rout of the Los Angeles Lakers in 2011, a win that completed a four-game sweep in the second round. Devin Booker scored 35 points for the Suns, but Chris Paul was in foul trouble the majority of the game, eventually fouling out early in the fourth quarter, finishing the game with 5 points and 6 fouls.\n After leading by 3 coming out of halftime, the Suns outscored the Mavericks 61–34, including a 17–0 run in the third quarter as the Suns won their fourth consecutive playoff game at home. Devin Booker led the Suns in points with 28, bringing his playoff career total to 804 points in 30 career playoff games. Luka Dončić finished with 28 points and 11 rebounds and Jalen Brunson added 21 points. However, the Mavericks shot just 38% from the field as a team, making just 9 assists, the lowest number of assists by a team in the playoffs since 2016.\nDuring the final seconds of the game, Suns center Bismack Biyombo was fouled on a dunk attempt by Mavericks forward Marquese Chriss. The two had a verbal altercation after the foul, and both players were subsequently ejected. After he was ejected, Chriss ran into the same tunnel that Biyombo had gone into, and the two exchanged further words. Security guards and Mavericks center Boban Marjanović helped separate the two players from each other.\n\n After previously going 0–2 in elimination games in his career, Luka Dončić scored 33 points and 11 rebounds to help the Mavericks force a game 7, with Dallas going on a decisive 19–5 run to finish the first half. Devin Booker scored 19 points, but was shut out from 3-point range (0-of-4) and committed a season-high eight turnovers, with the Suns shooting a playoff-low 40% with 22 turnovers, also a playoff-worst. Chris Paul also struggled, having more turnovers (5) than assists (4) for the second time in the last four games.\n This was the Suns' first game 7 since the 2006 Western Conference semifinals. In a series where every home team won their game, game 7 had a different outcome. The Mavericks dominated the entire game, never giving the Suns the lead, eventually going into halftime leading 57–27; the halftime deficit of 30 being the largest in game 7 history. The lead would later grow to as much as 46 as the Mavericks upset the Suns in 7 games, and advanced to the Western Conference finals for the first time since their championship run in 2011.\nLuka Dončić shined in the victory with a double-double (35 points, 10 rebounds, and 4 assists), while Jalen Brunson and Spencer Dinwiddie scored 24 and 30 points, respectively. Devin Booker had 11 points, and Chris Paul had 10 points and 4 assists as the duo were held to a combined 7-for-22 from the field. Chris Paul also became the first player ever to be on five teams that blew 2–0 leads in a best-of-7 series, along with losing his 4th consecutive game 7.\n\nThis was the third playoff meeting between these two teams, with each team winning one series.\n\n(2) Memphis Grizzlies vs. (3) Golden State Warriors\nKlay Thompson hit a go-ahead 3-pointer with 36 seconds left, and the Warriors overcame Draymond Green's first-half ejection to edge the Grizzlies 117–116. Jordan Poole led the Warriors with a career-high 31 points off the bench, hitting a playoff-best 5-of-10 3-pointers. Jaren Jackson Jr. matched his season high with six 3-pointers and had a playoff career-high 33 points. Ja Morant also led the team with 34 points and 10 assists, but missed the potential go-ahead layup as time expired.\n Ja Morant scored 47 points to match his postseason high and tie the series with a 106–101 victory over the Warriors. Morant scored the last 15 points for Memphis, starting with 4:16 left, along with hitting a 7-foot jumper with 1:42 left to permanently give Memphis the lead. Morant also became the third player in league history to have multiple 45-point games in the postseason before turning 23, joining LeBron James and Kobe Bryant.\n The Warriors scored over 140 points in a playoff game for the first time since 1967 as they routed the Grizzlies 142–112. Stephen Curry scored 30 points, Klay Thompson had 21 and nine rebounds and Golden State shut down the Memphis supporting cast, with no other Grizzlies player besides Ja Morant scoring more than 16 points. Morant had 34 points prior to injuring his right knee midway through the fourth quarter.\n With Warriors head coach Steve Kerr out after testing positive for COVID-19 and Ja Morant out for Memphis after injuring his right knee, Mike Brown took over head coaching duties for the Warriors and led Golden State on an 11–5 run to end the game, with Stephen Curry converting eight free throws over the final 45.7 seconds to finish the game with 32 points. The Warriors scored 39 points in the fourth, topping their 38 the entire first half. Jaren Jackson Jr. and Dillon Brooks combined for 33 points for the Grizzlies, but shot a combined 12-of-40 (30%) from the field.\n Facing elimination at home and their star Ja Morant doubtful for the remainder of the playoffs, the Grizzlies dominated game 5, leading by as much as 55 points at one point. Jaren Jackson Jr., Desmond Bane and Tyus Jones each scored 21 points as Memphis set a new record for widest margin of victory in a game in Grizzlies playoff history, as well as the widest margin of victory in the 2022 playoffs. The Warriors also lost for the first time with assistant Mike Brown filling in for coach Steve Kerr, who missed his second straight game since testing positive for COVID prior to game 4. Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry combined for 33 points, but Golden State turned the ball over 22 times, the most turnovers they had had in a game since 2014.\n Klay Thompson knocked down eight 3-pointers en route to 30 points and Stephen Curry scored 29 with six 3-pointers to send the Warriors to the Western Conference finals for the sixth time in the last eight years. Draymond Green also contributed 14 points, 15 rebounds and eight assists, along with Kevon Looney returning to the starting lineup and grabbing 22 rebounds, a career high. The Warriors also out-rebounded the Grizzlies 70–44, becoming the first team to grab 70-plus rebounds in a playoff game since 1983 and have 25 offensive rebounds, the most since 1987.\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between the two teams, with the Warriors winning the first meeting.\n\nConference finals\nNote: Times are EDT (UTC−4) as listed by the NBA. If the venue is located in a different time zone, the local time is also given.\n\nEastern Conference finals\n(1) Miami Heat vs. (2) Boston Celtics\nJimmy Butler scored 27 of his 41 points in the second half, and a huge third quarter by the Heat—in which Butler outscored the Celtics by himself—carried them to an 118–107 win. Jayson Tatum had 29 points and Jaylen Brown had 24, but were without starters Marcus Smart (foot) and Al Horford (health and safety protocols). Along with being outscored 39–14 in the third quarter, Boston failed to score a field goal in the first six minutes of the second half—the slowest start to a half in any of the Celtics' 94 games this season.\n Jayson Tatum scored 27 points, Marcus Smart and Jaylen Brown each had 24 as the Celtics went on a massive first-half run to roll past the Heat on the road. Boston used a 17–0 run late in the first quarter—fueled by five 3-pointers in the span of six possessions—to take control. Smart was also a rebound shy of a triple-double, after adding 12 assists and nine rebounds. Jimmy Butler had 29 points in 32 minutes, but no other player for Miami scored more than 14 points as the Heat suffered their first loss at home in these playoffs.\n After a blowout loss in Miami that cost them home-court advantage in the Eastern Conference finals, the Heat jumped to a 26-point first-half lead over the Celtics in game 3. Bam Adebayo scored 31 points with 10 rebounds, filling a void left by injured all-star Jimmy Butler, while also putting up six assists and four of the Heat's franchise postseason record 19 steals. The Celtics never led, but they cut a 46–20 deficit to 1 point on a 3-pointer from Jaylen Brown, who finished with 40 points.\n Despite being without Marcus Smart due to a right ankle sprain, the Celtics jumped out to a 26–4 first quarter lead and never trailed en route to dominating the Heat in game 4. Jayson Tatum led all scorers with 31 points, and Al Horford was masterful defensively for the Celtics, grabbing 13 rebounds and blocking four shots.\nFor Miami, they scored just 52 points in the first three quarters, with the Heat not successfully making a shot from the field until 3:21 left in the first quarter, the longest drought without a field goal to start a playoff game in the last 25 years. Victor Oladipo also came off the bench and outscored the entire Miami starting lineup, with the 18 points from the Heat starting five being the fewest points scored by a team's starters in a playoff game since starters were first tracked in 1971, and the first time an entire starting lineup was outscored by a player from its own bench.\n\n With Marcus Smart returning to the starting lineup for Boston and Tyler Herro ruled out for Miami due to a groin injury, the first half was a low-scoring affair with the score at halftime 42–37 in favor of the Heat. The game remained close until the 3rd quarter with 2:44 left. As the Celtics were ahead 59–58, they increased their lead with a 24–2 run which continued into the 4th quarter, eventually putting the game away as the Celtics became one game away from advancing to their first NBA Finals in 12 years. Jaylen Brown led the Celtics with 25 points while Jayson Tatum secured a double-double with 22 points, 12 rebounds and nine assists. Tatum (24 years and 83 days old) became the second-youngest player in NBA history to reach 1,500 playoff points.\nMeanwhile, the Heat shot 7-of-45 (15.6%) from three in game 5, which was the second-lowest three-point field goal percentage in NBA playoff history with 40-plus attempts. The Miami backcourt also struggled as Kyle Lowry and Max Strus went a combined 0-of-15 in the game, which was the worst \"zero-fer\" for a starting backcourt in a playoff game since starters were officially tracked in 1971.\n\n Coming into the game, many fans and experts believed that the season for the Heat was going to end after their lackluster performances in games 4 and 5, with Golden State Warriors player Draymond Green stating \"We're going to play Boston\" in response to who he would rather face in the 2022 NBA Finals.\nWith Miami facing elimination, Jimmy Butler scored a playoff career-high 47 points (shooting 16-for-29) to go with 9 rebounds, 8 assists, and four steals as the Heat forced a game 7. Kyle Lowry also had his best game of the series, scoring 18 points and 10 assists before fouling out late in the fourth quarter. For Boston, Jayson Tatum had 30 points and nine rebounds, while Derrick White came off the bench to score 11 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter. Jaylen Brown also scored 20 points for Boston, but missed a crucial pair of free throws with the game tied at 99 as the Heat finished the game on a 17–6 run.\nMany fans and media members compared Butler's performance to that of LeBron James when he was with the Heat during game 6 of the 2012 Eastern Conference finals (also against the Celtics), in which he scored 45 points, 15 rebounds & five assists on the road while facing elimination.\n\n Boston opened up on a 12–3 run and had a 15-point lead after one quarter. The Celtics led by 17 early in the second quarter, but the Heat would pull within 6 by halftime. The Heat cut the lead to 2 early in the third, but the Celtics responded to every second-half Miami rally, leading by as many as 14. Although the Heat cut the lead to just 3 points with 10 minutes left, the Celtics rebuilt their lead, and were up 98–85 with 3:25 left. The Heat then went on a furious 11–0 run in 3 minutes, bringing the score to 98–96. After Marcus Smart missed a driving layup with 20 seconds left, the Heat had a chance to tie or take the lead. However, Jimmy Butler missed a three-point shot, and Al Horford grabbed the defensive rebound, leading to two free throws that made it a 4-point game with 11 seconds to go. The Heat failed to score, and the Celtics won 100–96, with Boston never trailing in the game.\nWith the win, the Celtics advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2010 and for the 22nd time in their franchise history. Horford, in his 15th season, shed a record for the most playoff games without an NBA Finals appearance, at 141.\nJayson Tatum won the inaugural Eastern Conference finals MVP award, averaging 25.0 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 5.6 assists on 46% from the field, 35% from beyond the arc, and 86% from the free throw line.\nNotably, Mark Jones filled-in for Mike Breen as play-by-play commentator in game 7, with Jeff Van Gundy and Mark Jackson intact as analysts; Breen was out due to a positive COVID-19 test. Originally, Jones was to call the game on ESPN Radio with Doris Burke. However, with changes in the commentary team, Marc Kestecher joined Burke on ESPN Radio. game 7 was also the most watched conference finals game on ESPN in four years, averaging 9.9 million viewers and peaking at 12.1 million viewers.\n\nThis was the fifth playoff meeting between the two teams, with the Heat winning three of the first four meetings.\n\nWestern Conference finals\n(3) Golden State Warriors vs. (4) Dallas Mavericks\nStephen Curry had 21 points and a game-high 12 rebounds, while Jordan Poole and Andrew Wiggins both scored 19 as the Warriors took game 1 at home, with Golden State holding Dallas to their lowest field goal percentage of the playoffs (36.0%). Luka Dončić led the Mavericks with 20 points, but shot just 6-of-18 from the field, along with scoring just two points and committing six turnovers in the second half as the Mavericks lost their third straight game 1 of the playoffs.\n Luka Dončić had 18 points in the first quarter, and 42 points total. His 3-pointer with 13 seconds before halftime—the Mavs' 15th of the first half—made it 72–58 at the break. Although they trailed by 19 at one point, Golden State answered with a 25–13 third quarter to pull to 85–83 going into fourth. The Warriors would not look back from there, shooting 78.9% in the fourth quarter as Golden State outscored Dallas 68–45 in the second half. Stephen Curry scored 32 points with six 3-pointers and eight rebounds, while Kevon Looney had a career-high 21 points and 12 rebounds.\n Stephen Curry scored 31 points, while Andrew Wiggins's playoff career-high 27 points helped Golden State beat the Mavericks to take a 3–0 lead in the Western Conference finals. Luka Dončić scored 40 points and shot 4-for-9 from beyond the arc, but that was a blip on an otherwise rough night from 3-point range for the Mavericks, who missed their first seven and finished 13-of-45 (28.9%).\nThe game is notable for a highlight play that occurred with 6:40 left in the 4th quarter with the score 91–83 in favor of the Warriors. Stephen Curry passed the ball to Andrew Wiggins who drove down the baseline to dunk, posterizing Luka Dončić. The play was controversially called an offensive foul on Wiggins (which would have nullified the dunk), but the call was reversed to no foul and a good basket after a successful challenge by Warriors coach Steve Kerr.\n\n With the Warriors having a chance to sweep and head to the NBA Finals, the Mavericks dominated the entire game after the 1st quarter, going on a 25–6 run in a span of 7 minutes during the 2nd quarter, eventually leading 62–47 by halftime, and increasing the lead by 29 by the 4th quarter. The Warriors, however, thanks in part to Jonathan Kuminga and Moses Moody, rallied a comeback attempt, decreasing the deficit to 8 with 3:23 left in the 4th quarter, resulting in Steve Kerr to bring back in his starters. However, the Mavericks would silence the rally, keeping their season alive and forcing a fifth game in San Francisco. Luka Dončić scored a near triple-double with 30 points, 14 rebounds and nine assists. Stephen Curry scored 20 points and eight assists, while Jonathan Kuminga grabbed eight rebounds.\n After tearing his left ACL in the 2019 NBA Finals and then tearing his right Achilles' tendon just before the start of the 2020–21 season, Klay Thompson helped send the Warriors to their sixth NBA Finals in the last eight years, scoring 32 points and shooting 8-for-16 from 3-point range. Kevon Looney also scored 10 points and grabbed 18 rebounds, finishing the game with more offensive rebounds (7) than the Mavericks (6).\nStephen Curry was awarded the inaugural Western Conference finals MVP award, averaging 23.8 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 7.4 assists on 44% from the field, 44% from beyond the arc, and 84% from the free throw line.\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Warriors winning the first meeting.\n\nNBA Finals: (W3) Golden State Warriors vs. (E2) Boston Celtics\nNote: Times are EDT (UTC−4) as listed by the NBA. If the venue is located in a different time zone, the local time is also given.\n\nThis was the fifth playoff meeting between the two teams, and the second since the Philadelphia Warriors relocated to the Bay Area in 1962, with the Celtics winning the first four meetings.\n\nStatistical leaders\nMedia coverage\nTelevision\nESPN, ABC, TNT, and NBA TV broadcast the playoffs nationally in the United States.

This also marked the first time since 1976 that Texas did not appear in the playoffs.\nAll four California teams (Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles Clippers, Los Angeles Lakers, and Sacramento Kings) made the playoffs in the same season for the first time since the Kings relocated to Sacramento in 1985.\nAll five teams from the Pacific Division qualified for the playoffs, marking the third instance every team in a division qualified for the playoffs since the NBA adopted the current six division format in 2004–05.

The last time a sweep did not occur was in 1976. This was the 183rd series sweep in NBA playoffs history.\nJa Morant scored 22 straight points for the Memphis Grizzlies in game 3 against the Los Angeles Lakers, becoming the first player to score at least 22 straight points for their team in a playoff game since Kobe Bryant in 2010.\nJimmy Butler became the sixth player in NBA history to score 56 or more points in a playoff game, joining Michael Jordan (twice), Elgin Baylor, Donovan Mitchell, Charles Barkley, and Wilt Chamberlain.\nDevin Booker became the third player since 1997 to score at least 25 points in a quarter in a playoff game, joining Damian Lillard (25 in 2019) and Allen Iverson (26 in 2001).\nDevin Booker and Kevin Durant became the first duo in playoff history to each score 25-plus points in each of their first six games of a postseason.\nThe New York Knicks won a playoff series for the first time since 2013.\nGiannis Antetokounmpo missed 13 free throws in game 5 against the Heat, marking the most free throw misses in a playoff game since DeAndre Jordan in 2015, and the most misses in any game (regular season or playoffs) since Ben Simmons in 2017.\nThe Heat became the first play–in team in NBA history to win a playoff series.\nThe eighth-seeded Heat defeated the top-seeded Milwaukee Bucks in five games, marking the sixth instance in NBA history of an 8th-seeded team defeating a 1st-seeded team in the first round, following previous instances in 1994, 1999, 2007, 2011, and 2012. Additionally, this was the fourth time such an upset occurred in a best-of-seven series, and the first to be completed in fewer than six games.\nThe seventh-seeded Lakers defeated the second-seeded Grizzlies in six games, marking the sixth instance in NBA history of a 7th-seeded team defeating a 2nd-seeded team in the first round, following previous instances in 1987, 1989, 1991, 1998, and 2010. Additionally, this was only the second time such an upset occurred in a best-of-seven series.\nA seventh-seed (Lakers) and an eighth-seed (Heat) both advanced in the first round of the playoffs, marking the first time this happened since the 16-team format began in 1984. In all previous instances when a seventh or eighth seed advanced, only one or the other advanced (not both).\nThe Kings–Warriors series was the first of the 2023 playoffs to have a game 7, making it the 24th consecutive NBA postseason to feature a game 7. The last time a game 7 did not occur in the playoffs was 1999. This was the 148th game 7 in NBA playoffs history.\nStephen Curry's 50 points against the Kings was the first 50-point performance in a game 7 in NBA history.\n\nConference semifinals\nThis was the first time in NBA history that every seed number from 1 through 8 made it to the second round across both conferences.\nThe sixth-seeded Warriors had home-court advantage in the western semifinals, becoming the lowest seed to have home-court advantage since the sixth-seeded Houston Rockets in 1987.\nP. J. Tucker had zero field goal attempts and zero free throw attempts in 37 minutes played against the Boston Celtics, marking the most minutes played without a field goal or free throw attempt in a playoff game in the shot-clock era (since 1954–55).\nDevin Booker's 35.9 points per game were the most through a player's first ten games of a postseason since Michael Jordan in 1990.\nThe Denver Nuggets' 81 first-half points in game 6 against the Phoenix Suns were the most in a first half by an away team in postseason history.\nJalen Brunson became the fourth player in NBA history to make more field goals than the rest of the team combined in an elimination game, joining LeBron James (twice), Kobe Bryant, and Penny Hardaway.\nWith the defending champion Warriors losing to the Los Angeles Lakers, the 2023 playoffs marked the fourth straight year where the defending champion was eliminated before the conference finals.\nThe Warriors lost a playoff series to a Western Conference opponent for the first time in the Steve Kerr era (since 2014–15).\nWith the Lakers' series win over the Warriors, LeBron James earned his 41st career playoff series win, setting a new NBA record for the most career playoff series wins and surpassing Derek Fisher's previous record of 40.\nAfter losing Game 5 in the Warriors series, LeBron James lost 3 consecutive games at the first chance of clinching a series. The streak included Game 5 losses to the Grizzlies in the previous round this year and to the Heat in the 2020 Finals. Before the current losing streak, James won 5 straight and 15 of his last 16, with the lone loss being in the first round to the Pacers in 2018\nJayson Tatum's 51 points against the 76ers were the most in a game 7 in NBA history.\nAdditionally, his 51 points and zero turnovers set a playoff record for the most points in a game without any turnovers.\nThere were four 50-point games this postseason, the most in a single postseason.\nDoc Rivers, as a coach, has now blown seven 3–2 series leads. Out of those seven, three of them were 3–1 series leads.\n\nConference finals\nThe Heat became the second eight-seeded team to reach the conference finals, joining the 1999 New York Knicks.\nThe Heat also became the first eight-seeded team to reach the conference finals in a full 82-game season, as the 1998–99 season was shortened due to a lockout.\nThe Lakers became the second seven-seeded team to reach the conference finals, joining the 1987 Seattle SuperSonics.\nAll four teams in the conference finals from the 2020 Bubble returned to the 2023 conference finals.\nLike the aforementioned season, the Heat and Celtics have both beaten the Bucks and 76ers, respectively. The Heat also had beaten the Celtics in the Eastern Conference finals.\nThe Heat became the fifth team to win the series opener on the road in each of their first three playoff series, joining the 1981 Houston Rockets, 1989 Chicago Bulls, 1999 New York Knicks, and 2021 Atlanta Hawks.\nThe Heat became the first eight-seeded team since the 1999 Knicks to go up 3–0 in a series.\nThe Heat became the first eight-seeded team to win a playoff game by more than 25 points.\nThe Celtics lost their 6th game 7 at home this year, with previous losses in 1973, 1982, 2005, 2009 and 2018, while no other team has lost more than three. Both the Heat (2000, 2005, 2022) and the Suns (1981, 1995, 2022) lost three games 7 at home.\nThis was the second instance (following the 2015 playoffs) where both conference finals series had teams go up 3–0 in the series. However, the difference is that the Nuggets completed their sweep while the Celtics won three straight games but fell short.\nNikola Jokić recorded his eighth triple-double of the 2023 playoffs in game 4 against the Lakers, breaking the record held by Wilt Chamberlain for the most triple-doubles in a single postseason.\nThe Nuggets beat the Lakers 4–0 in the conference finals, marking their first playoff series sweep in franchise history.\nThe Nuggets also became the last of the four teams from the American Basketball Association to reach the NBA Finals.\nThe Nuggets also eliminated the Lakers in the playoffs for the first time in eight encounters, having been eliminated by the Lakers in 1979, 1985, 1987, 2008, 2009, 2012 and 2020.\nThe Nuggets became the 4th Western Conference team to sweep the Lakers en route to their first championship, following the footsteps of the Trail Blazers (1977), the Spurs (1999) and the Mavericks (2011).\nSince the Lakers joined the league in 1948–49, of the nine teams that won their first NBA championships while representing the West, seven eliminated the Lakers en route to their titles. In 2023, the Nuggets joined the Royals (1951), the Bucks (1971), the Trail Blazers (1977), the SuperSonics (1979), the Spurs (1999) and the Mavericks (2011). Only the 1958 Hawks and the 1994 Rockets did not do so.\nThis marked the third time LeBron James was swept in a playoff series. The last two times he was swept were in the NBA Finals against the San Antonio Spurs in 2007 and the Golden State Warriors in 2018.\nJokić became the second player to average a triple-double in multiple playoff series in a single postseason, joining Wilt Chamberlain in 1967.\nThe Celtics became the fourth team ever to force a game 7 after trailing 0–3 in a series, and the first team to do so since 2003.\nAdditionally, the Celtics became the first team to host a game 7 after trailing 0–3.\nDerrick White became the second player in NBA history to hit a buzzer-beater with his team trailing and facing elimination, joining Michael Jordan's \"The Shot\" in 1989.\nIt was also the sixth game-winning buzzer-beater when facing elimination in NBA history, and the first since Kawhi Leonard in 2019. Coincidentally, Jimmy Butler has been on the losing side of three of those buzzer-beaters.\nJaylen Brown became the fifth player with 8-plus turnovers in a game 7 since individual turnovers were tracked in 1978, joining Shawn Kemp, LeBron James, Donovan Mitchell, and Joel Embiid.\nAfter Game 4 of the Western Conference Finals, the Lakers lost six consecutive games while facing playoff elimination. The streak included Game 6 vs. the Suns (2021), Game 4 vs. the Spurs (2013), Game 5 vs. the Thunder (2012), Game 4 vs. the Mavericks (2011) and Game 6 vs. the Celtics (2008). They also lost 15 out of their last 16. Before winning Game 5 of the 2008 Finals against the Celtics, they also lost Game 5 vs. the Suns (2007), Game 7 vs. the Suns (2006), Game 5 vs. the Pistons (2004), Game 6 vs. the Spurs (2003), Game 4 vs. the Spurs (1999), Game 4 vs. the Jazz (1998), Game 5 vs. the Jazz (1997), Game 4 vs. the Rockets (1996), and Game 6 vs. the Spurs (1995).\n\nNBA Finals\nThe Heat became the second eight-seeded team to reach the NBA Finals, joining the 1999 New York Knicks. Coincidentally, both the Knicks and the Heat beat each other during their respective run to the Finals.\nThe Heat also became the first eight-seeded team to reach the Finals in a full 82-game season, as the 1998–99 season was shortened due to a lockout.\nFor the first time, an NHL and NBA team from the same metro area made the final as the lowest seed in the same season. Ironically, both the Heat and the Florida Panthers would lose to the number 1 seed in the Western Conference in 5 games.\nThe Heat became the first team to make the NBA Finals after making the playoffs via the Play-In tournament.\nThe Heat became the third team in NBA history to finish last in PPG (points per game) during the regular season and reach the NBA Finals, joining the 1956 Fort Wayne Pistons and 1964 San Francisco Warriors.\nIn game 1, the Heat had two free throw attempts, breaking the NBA record for the fewest free throw attempts in a playoff game. The previous playoff record was three, by the New Jersey Nets in 1993 and the previous Finals record was five, by the Los Angeles Lakers in 1983.\nThe Heat collected their 13th win of the playoffs in game 2 against the Nuggets, breaking a tie with the 1999 Knicks for the most wins ever by a No. 8 seed in a single postseason.\nIn game 3, Nikola Jokić and Jamal Murray became the first teammates to record a triple-double in the NBA Finals and the first teammates to both record 30-point triple-doubles in any game.\nUdonis Haslem, aged 42 years, 363 days, became the oldest player to play in the NBA Finals, coming off the bench in the last minute.\nNikola Jokić became the first player in NBA history to put up at least 500 points, 250 rebounds, and 150 assists in a single postseason run.\nNikola Jokić became the first player in NBA history to lead the league in points (600), rebounds (269), and assists (190) in a single postseason.\nNikola Jokić was the lowest-selected player to be named NBA Finals MVP. Jokić was selected 41st overall in the 2014 NBA draft.\n\nFormat\nEight teams from each conference participated in the playoffs. The top six teams in each conference, based on winning percentage, directly qualified for the playoffs; the seeding order of those teams was also based on winning percentage. If two or more teams had the same record, standard NBA tiebreaker rules were used.\nThe NBA Board of Governors adopted a format starting in 2021 to have a play-in tournament involving the teams ranked 7th through 10th in each conference. The 7th-place team and 8th-place team participated in a \"double-chance\" game, with the winner advancing to the playoffs as the 7-seed. The loser then played the winner of the elimination game between the 9th-place and 10th-place teams to determine the playoff's 8-seed. The NBA's regular playoff format then proceeded as normal.\nEach conference's bracket was fixed with no reseeding. All rounds were a best-of-seven series; a series ended when one team won four games, and that team advanced to the next round. All rounds, including the NBA Finals, were in a 2–2–1–1–1 format with regards to hosting. In the conference playoffs, home-court advantage went to the higher-seeded team (number one being the highest). For the NBA Finals, home-court advantage went to the team with the better regular season record, and, if needed, ties were broken based on head-to-head record, followed by intra-conference record.\n\nPlayoff qualifying\nOn March 14, 2023, the Milwaukee Bucks became the first team to clinch a playoff spot. While noted in the below tables, division titles have no bearing on seeding.\nSeeds 7 and 8 in each conference were determined via the first-stage play-in tournament, held April 11–14.\n\nEastern Conference\nToronto (41–41) and Chicago (40–42) also secured play-in berths but did not advance to the playoffs.\n\nWestern Conference\nNew Orleans (42–40) and Oklahoma City (40–42) also secured play-in berths but did not advance to the playoffs.\n\nPlay-in tournament brackets\nEastern Conference\nBold Game winner\nItalic Team with home-court advantage\n\nWestern Conference\nBold Game winner\nItalic Team with home-court advantage\n\nBracket\nTeams in bold advanced to the next round. The numbers to the left of each team indicate the team's seeding in its conference, and the numbers to the right indicate the number of games the team won in that round. The division champions are marked by an asterisk. Teams with home-court advantage (i.e., the higher-seeded team) are shown in italics.\n\nFirst round\nNote: Times are EDT (UTC−4) as listed by the NBA. If the venue is located in a different time zone, the local time is also given.\n\nEastern Conference first round\n(1) Milwaukee Bucks vs. (8) Miami Heat\nThe Heat took advantage of Giannis Antetokounmpo's early exit in the first half to secure a 1–0 series lead. Jimmy Butler led Miami with 35 points, while Bam Adebayo contributed 22 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists. However, the Heat also suffered a setback, as they lost Tyler Herro to a broken hand in the second quarter. Miami had built a 68–55 halftime lead before Herro's departure and maintained their advantage by shooting an impressive 60% from beyond the arc, their highest percentage of the season. Khris Middleton stepped up for the Bucks, finishing with 33 points and nine rebounds, but Milwaukee shooting 24.4% from the three-point line hindered any chance at a comeback.\n After shooting 11-of-45 from three-point range in their Game 1 loss, the Bucks shot 25-of-49 from beyond the arc, tying the 2016 Cleveland Cavaliers for the most three-point makes by a team in a playoff game. Despite Giannis Antetokounmpo's absence, Milwaukee managed to dominate the Heat thanks to a team effort, as six Bucks players scored at least 16 points. Brook Lopez scored 25 points, Jrue Holiday added 24 points, and Pat Connaughton dropped a playoff career-high 22 points, shooting 6-of-10 from beyond the arc. Jimmy Butler scored 25 for Miami, but it was not enough to keep up with the hot shooting of the Bucks, as they led by as much as 36 points.\n The No. 8 seeded Heat retook their series lead with a 121–99 victory over the shorthanded Bucks. Jimmy Butler led the way for Miami with 30 points in 28 minutes on 12-of-19 shooting. After Milwaukee went 10-of-18 (56%) from deep in the first half, they cooled off after halftime, shooting only 5-of-21 (24%) from three-point range in the second half. Khris Middleton scored 23 points, while Jrue Holiday added 19 and Grayson Allen scored 14. Meanwhile, Miami's Duncan Robinson scored 20 points on his 29th birthday, while Kyle Lowry added 15 points as the Heat led by as much as 29 points. The win was bittersweet for Miami, as Victor Oladipo left the game with a season-ending knee injury in the fourth quarter.\n Jimmy Butler scored a career-high 56 points, which included 21 in the fourth quarter to push the team with the best overall record on the verge of elimination. Down by 12 with under six minutes remaining, the Heat went on a pivotal 27–8 run, which included a 13–0 run to take their first lead of the night. Butler, who scored 22 of Miami's 28 first quarter points, finished 19-of-28 from the field, 15-of-18 from the foul line, and added nine rebounds. His 56 points also set a franchise playoff record for the Heat. Brook Lopez was the leading scorer for the Bucks, with 36 points and 11 rebounds. Giannis Antetokounmpo returned from a two-game absence with a bruised back and had a triple-double, with 26 points, ten rebounds, and 13 assists.\n Two nights after outscoring Milwaukee 30–13 in the final six minutes of a 119–115 victory in Miami, the Heat came back from a 16-point fourth-quarter deficit and tied the game on Jimmy Butler's layup with half a second left in regulation. The Heat went on to win in overtime, becoming the sixth 8-seeded team to knock off a No. 1 seed and the first play-in team ever to win a playoff series. Butler, who averaged 37.6 points throughout the series, led Miami with 42 points, while Bam Adebayo dropped a 20-point triple-double. Khris Middleton scored 33 points for the Bucks, while Giannis Antetokounmpo had 38 points and 20 rebounds. However, he missed a career-high 13 free-throw attempts, the most misses by any player in a playoff game since 2015. Despite leading 102–86 heading into the fourth quarter, the Bucks crumbled under pressure, shooting just 5-of-25 from the floor in the final quarter and overtime.\nThe Heat's upset of the Bucks was seen as reminiscent of the series that occurred in the 2020 NBA Bubble, where the Heat also toppled the higher-seeded Bucks in five games.\n\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Heat winning two of the first three meetings.\n\n(2) Boston Celtics vs. (7) Atlanta Hawks\nJaylen Brown guided Boston to a 112–99 victory with 29 points and 12 rebounds, while Jayson Tatum added 25 points, 21 of which came in the first half as the Celtics built a 30-point lead at halftime. Derrick White also had a strong performance with 24 points and seven assists. The Hawks meanwhile struggled with their shooting, missing their first ten three-point attempts and shooting 5-of-29 from beyond the arc for the game. Despite a late push from Atlanta in the fourth quarter, the Celtics regained control and secured the victory, as they held Dejounte Murray and Trae Young to a combined 15-of-43 shooting.\n Jayson Tatum led the Celtics to a 2–0 series lead over the Hawks, finishing with 29 points and ten rebounds. The Hawks once again tried mounting a comeback, as they pulled within eight points with under eight minutes left in regulation. However, the Celtics responded with a 20–6 run to put the game out of reach. Derrick White contributed 26 points, seven rebounds, and three blocks for Boston, while Jaylen Brown added 18 points.  Although Young and Dejounte Murray combined for 53 points, Atlanta could not keep up with Boston, who outscored them 64–40 in the paint.\n In danger of falling behind 3–0 in the series, Trae Young scored 32 points and nine assists in his first 30-point game since the Hawks' Conference finals run two years ago as Atlanta put up their most points in a playoff game since 1986. Young was supported by his backcourt partner Dejounte Murray, who had 25 points, six rebounds, and five assists. The duo played their best when it mattered most, as they accounted for 22 of Atlanta's 30 points in the final quarter. Jayson Tatum scored 29 points, while Marcus Smart added 24, but Boston was forced to play catch-up the majority of the game, as they allowed Atlanta to knock down 30-of-46 shots (65%) in the first half.\n After starting off the game shooting 1-of-7, Jaylen Brown removed his protective mask in the second quarter as he went on to shoot 11-of-15 the rest of the way, moving Boston to the brink of advancing to the second round. Jayson Tatum also had 31 points for the Celtics, as both Brown and Tatum combined to score their team's final 16 points, thwarting any attempt by the Hawks to even the series. In addition to the duo's combined 62 points, Marcus Smart added 19 points and Derrick White had 18. Although Trae Young scored 35 points and 15 assists, and De'Andre Hunter and Dejounte Murray combined for 50 points, the Hawks were unable to gain a lead after the first quarter.\n Facing elimination, Trae Young scored 38 points and hit a deep three-pointer with less than two seconds left to give the Hawks the lead and ultimately force a Game 6 in Atlanta. Young also had 16 points in a frenetic fourth quarter, getting support from his teammates who knocked down a series-best 19 three-pointers. John Collins added 22 points for Atlanta, who played without Dejounte Murray, who was suspended for bumping an official in Game 4. Despite an impressive performance from Jaylen Brown, who scored 35 points, and Jayson Tatum, who added 19, the Celtics ultimately lost control of the game in the fourth quarter, allowing Atlanta to outscore them 23–8 in the final minutes, with 14 of those points coming from Young.\n After collapsing late in Game 5, the Celtics responded by closing out Game 6 on an 18–7 run to advance to their sixth Eastern Semifinals appearance in seven years. Leading the way for the Celtics were Jaylen Brown with 32 points, Jayson Tatum with 30 points and 14 rebounds, Marcus Smart with 22 points, and Malcolm Brogdon with 17 points off the bench. Meanwhile, Trae Young, who finished with 30 points and ten assists, missed 12-of-13 shots in the second half and finished just 9-of-28 from the field. His backcourt partner Dejounte Murray also struggled, scoring zero points in the first half as the duo ultimately combined for a shooting percentage of 34% (14-of-41).\n\nThis was the 13th playoff meeting between these two teams, and the ninth since the St. Louis Hawks relocated to Atlanta in 1968, with the Celtics winning ten of the first twelve meetings.\n\n(3) Philadelphia 76ers vs. (6) Brooklyn Nets\nJames Harden led the way for the 76ers with 23 points and 13 assists, including seven three-pointers as Philadelphia moved to 5–0 against the Nets this season. Joel Embiid contributed 26 points for Philadelphia, while Tobias Harris added 21 points. The 76ers also set a team record for playoff three-pointers, with 21 made shots from beyond the arc; with 13 of them coming in the first half. Mikal Bridges had a standout performance for the Nets, making 10-of-16 shots for 23 points in the first half and keeping Brooklyn within nine at halftime, but the Nets never led in the game.\n Being heavily defended throughout the game, Joel Embiid showed increased trust in his teammates as Tyrese Maxey scored 33 points and Tobias Harris had 20 points and 12 rebounds, while Embiid contributed with 19 rebounds, seven assists, and three blocks as Philadelphia took a commanding 2–0 series lead. After a slow start, the 76ers rallied in the second half and held off the Nets, who shot 35% from the field in the second half. Cameron Johnson scored 22 of his 28 points in the first half, but Brooklyn was unable to get anything going in the second half, scoring just 35 points.\n With James Harden ejected in the third quarter and Joel Embiid struggling offensively, the 76ers rode Tyrese Maxey's team-high 25 points, including ten points in the final three minutes to give Philadelphia a 3–0 series lead. Although Joel Embiid was held to just 14 points on 5-of-13 shooting, he remained dominant on the defensive end and sealed the game by blocking a potential game-tying layup by Spencer Dinwiddie with just under ten seconds left. Mikal Bridges led the Nets with 26 points, but Brooklyn was held to just 15 points in the fourth quarter as the 76ers finished the game on an 11–1 run to hand the Nets their ninth consecutive playoff loss.\n Without Joel Embiid, Tobias Harris led Philadelphia with 25 points and 12 rebounds, while James Harden contributed 17 points and 11 assists as the 76ers swept a playoff opponent for the first time since 1991. Paul Reed, who replaced Embiid in the starting lineup, contributed ten points and 15 rebounds, while De'Anthony Melton scored all 15 of his points in the fourth quarter. The 76ers' defense also limited the Nets to 40 points in the second half and outscored Brooklyn 21–4 during an eight-minute stretch in the third quarter. Despite Spencer Dinwiddie's 20 points and Nic Claxton's 19 points and 12 rebounds, the Nets lost their tenth consecutive playoff game. Additionally, they went 0–8 against Philadelphia this season.\n\nThis was the fourth playoff meeting between these two teams, and the second since the New Jersey Nets relocated to Brooklyn in 2012, with the 76ers winning two of the first three meetings.\n\n(4) Cleveland Cavaliers vs. (5) New York Knicks\nWith the help of 27 points from Jalen Brunson, the Knicks stunned the Cavaliers in Cleveland. Julius Randle and Josh Hart each had ten rebounds, in addition to scoring 19 and 17 points, respectively. Donovan Mitchell led the way for Cleveland in the losing effort, logging 38 points, eight assists, and five rebounds in 44 minutes. Jarrett Allen finished with 14 points and 14 rebounds, and Darius Garland scored 17 points. Cleveland rallied from ten points behind early in the fourth quarter to lead by one with a little over two minutes left in the game, but the Knicks regained the lead on a three-pointer by Hart and an offensive rebound by Randle sealed the win for New York.\n After a lackluster playoff debut, Darius Garland bounced back with a dominant performance, scoring 26 of his 32 points in the first half to lead the Cavaliers to their first playoff victory without LeBron James on their roster since 1998. Caris LeVert scored 24 points off the bench for Cleveland and Donovan Mitchell added 17 points and a playoff career-high 13 assists.

Boston led the majority of the game thanks to a 14–4 run to start the game, with six Celtics players scoring in double figures. Although Philadelphia pulled within four points late in the final quarter, Boston hit timely three-pointers that prevented the 76ers from gaining any more ground. Despite Embiid's 30-point and 13-rebound performance on one good knee, James Harden and Tyrese Maxey's combined shooting of 7-for-30 (23%) left him with little offensive support.\n After having the worst shooting stretch of his career over any two-game span in Games 2 and 3, James Harden bounced back in Game 4 by scoring 42 points on 16-of-23 shooting to help Philadelphia tie the series at two games apiece.

Despite trailing by as much as 16 points in the first half, the 76ers rallied thanks to the efforts of Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey, who helped the team take the lead entering the fourth quarter. However, Philadelphia faltered down the stretch, missing all eight of their three-point attempts in the fourth and failing to make a single field goal over the last six minutes until garbage time. Embiid and Maxey scored 26 points each, while James Harden shot a poor 4-of-16 from the field.\n In a historic performance, Jayson Tatum scored a playoff career-high 51 points, setting a new record for the most points ever scored in a game 7 as he led the Celtics to their fifth conference finals appearance in seven years.

Additionally, 76ers head coach Doc Rivers has now lost a record 10 game sevens, with his teams going 4–13 in their last 17 chances to close out a playoff series.\n\nThis was the 23rd playoff meeting between these two teams, and the 15th since the Syracuse Nationals relocated to Philadelphia in 1963, with the Celtics winning 14 of the first 22 meetings.\n\n(5) New York Knicks vs. (8) Miami Heat\nAfter the Knicks led the majority of the first half, the Heat pulled away in the third quarter with a 21–5 run highlighted by a Kevin Love three-pointer that gave Miami a lead they would not relinquish.

Jimmy Butler, who returned from his one-game absence, scored 28 points, Max Strus added 19 points, and Bam Adebayo had a double-double for the Heat, who never trailed. Meanwhile, New York struggled to find their rhythm, as their top three scorers from the regular season (Jalen Brunson, Julius Randle, and RJ Barrett) shot a combined 16-of-51 (31%) from the field, including 2-of-17 (12%) from beyond the arc.\n Led by Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo, the Heat moved one win away from their third trip to the conference finals in four years. Butler finished with 27 points and ten assists, while Adebayo contributed 23 points and 13 rebounds as Miami became the fourth No. 8 seed to win at least seven playoff games.

Bam Adebayo and Duncan Robinson also contributed with 18 and 17 points respectively, but Miami struggled from deep, missing 21 of their first 25 three-pointers.\n The Heat advanced to the conference finals for the seventh time in the last 13 seasons and became just the second No. 8 seed ever to reach the conference finals. Despite an early 14-point lead by the Knicks, Miami took the lead by halftime and held it throughout the second half. However, up by six with under a minute remaining, Gabe Vincent's flagrant foul on Jalen Brunson allowed New York to score four points in five seconds. After a Jimmy Butler miss, the Knicks had an opportunity to tie the game, but Kyle Lowry came up with a steal, and Butler made free throws with 14 seconds left to clinch the win for the Heat. Butler scored 24 points, Bam Adebayo added 23, and Lowry had nine assists. Meanwhile, Brunson scored 41 points, accounting for over half of the Knicks' 27 made field goals.

Kevin Durant added 24 points, but went 10-of-27 shooting, including just 2-for-12 from beyond the arc.\n Without Chris Paul and down 2–0 in the series, Devin Booker shot 80% (20-of-25) from the field and tied his playoff career-high with 47 points, recording his third 45-point performance of the playoffs en route to cutting Denver's series lead to 2–1.

Booker shot 14-of-18 from the field, as he boosted his shooting percentage at home to 79% (34-of-43) for the series. The Suns were able to take a six-point lead into the fourth quarter after a scoring flurry from Booker, who had 17 points in the third quarter. Although Denver attempted to rally, backup guard Landry Shamet made four timely three-pointers to keep Phoenix ahead, as the Suns' bench outscored the Nuggets' bench 40–11. For Denver, Nikola Jokić shot 20-of-30 from the field, while Jamal Murray added 28 points and seven assists.\n Nikola Jokić's tenth career playoff triple-double led the Nuggets to a pivotal Game 5 victory over the Suns, improving to 37–4 at home this season with Jokić on the floor. Jokić had a standout third quarter, as he made 7-of-8 shots for 17 points and helped the Nuggets turn a three-point halftime lead into a 91–74 advantage. Michael Porter Jr. scored 14 of his 19 points in the first quarter, Jamal Murray contributed 19 points and six assists, and Bruce Brown scored 25 of Denver's 34 bench points. Although Devin Booker and Kevin Durant each scored 25-plus points for the ninth time this postseason, the Suns were outrebounded 50–42 and outshot from beyond the arc 48% to 33%, as they trailed by as much as 24 points.\n The Nuggets secured a spot in the conference finals by defeating the shorthanded Suns by 25 points, the largest win margin by a road team this postseason. Denver dominated the game, using a 23–2 run in the latter part of the first quarter to establish a commanding 44–26 lead. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who had been averaging 9.5 points in the playoffs, scored 17 points in the first quarter, while Nikola Jokić contributed 14.

Cameron Payne led Phoenix, who were without Deandre Ayton and Chris Paul, with a career-high 31 points, hitting 7-of-9 three-pointers. Kevin Durant added 23 points, but missed nine of his first ten shots as the Suns fell behind by 30 points at halftime in an elimination game for the second straight year.\nNotably, this was Al McCoy's final game, concluding his 51-year career as the Suns' play-by-play radio announcer.\n\nThis was the fifth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Suns winning three of the first four meetings.\n\n(6) Golden State Warriors vs. (7) Los Angeles Lakers\nAnthony Davis put up 30 points, 23 rebounds, and four blocks, while LeBron James added 22 points and 11 boards as the Lakers held off a late push by Golden State to win Game 1 on the road.

Down 14 with under six minutes left, Golden State went on a 14–0 run to tie the game.

LeBron James contributed 27 points and six assists, Austin Reaves scored 21 points, and Anthony Davis had 23 points and 15 rebounds for Los Angeles. For the Warriors, Stephen Curry had 31 points, ten rebounds, and 14 assists in his third career postseason triple-double, but he missed 11-of-14 three-point attempts and turned the ball over in the final seconds.\n In a must-win situation, the Warriors rallied behind Stephen Curry's 27 points and eight assists, along with Andrew Wiggins' 25 points and seven rebounds to avoid elimination. Draymond Green contributed 20 points and ten rebounds, while Gary Payton II scored 13 points.

Additionally, Austin Reaves scored 23 points, including a 54-foot shot from midcourt at the halftime buzzer, as Los Angeles never trailed in the game.

Klay Thompson missed ten of his 12 three-point attempts as the Splash Brothers went dry when it mattered most, with Thompson going 10-of-36 from deep in the final four games, while Curry was 14-of-49. This also marked the Warriors' first playoff series loss to a Western Conference opponent under Steve Kerr, having previously gone 19–0.\n\nThis was the eighth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning six of the first seven meetings.\n\nConference finals\nNote: Times are EDT (UTC−4) as listed by the NBA. If the venue is located in a different time zone, the local time is also given.\n\nEastern Conference finals\n(2) Boston Celtics vs. (8) Miami Heat\nJimmy Butler and the eight-seeded Heat rallied in the second half to win Game 1 on the road for the third straight series, becoming just the fifth team ever to do so. Trailing by nine at halftime, Miami scored a franchise playoff-record 46 points in the third quarter, as they were fueled by their success from beyond the arc, shooting over 50% from deep (16-of-31). Butler scored a game-high 35 points to go along with seven assists, six steals, and five rebounds. Bam Adebayo added 20 points, while Kyle Lowry, Caleb Martin, Gabe Vincent, and Max Strus each scored 15 points. Jayson Tatum led the Celtics with 30 points, but failed to attempt a shot in the fourth quarter. Jaylen Brown added 22 points and nine rebounds, while Malcolm Brogdon contributed 19 points. Although Boston narrowed the deficit to four points late in the fourth quarter, they ultimately fell short, dropping to 4–4 at home this postseason.\n Similar to how they defeated the Milwaukee Bucks and New York Knicks, the Heat overcame their sixth double-digit deficit of the playoffs to take a commanding 2–0 series lead back to Miami. Jimmy Butler scored 27 points, including nine points during an 18–4 run late in the fourth quarter that turned a nine-point deficit into a 105–100 lead. Bam Adebayo recorded 22 points, 17 rebounds, and nine assists, while Caleb Martin came off the bench and provided a season-high 25 points as the Heat became the first No. 8 seed to take a 2–0 series lead in the conference finals. Meanwhile, Jayson Tatum put up 34 points, 13 rebounds, and eight assists, but he failed to make a field goal in the fourth quarter for the second straight game. Jaylen Brown did not fare well either, as he converted just seven of his 23 shot attempts and went 1-of-5 from the field in the fourth, as Miami outscored Boston 36–22 in the final quarter.\n In a dominant team effort, the eight-seeded Heat improved to 6–0 at home this postseason and moved one win away from their sixth NBA Finals appearance in the last 13 seasons. Gabe Vincent scored a career-high 29 points on 11-of-14 shooting, Duncan Robinson scored 22, and Caleb Martin added 18 points, all of whom went undrafted. In addition, Jimmy Butler had 16 points and six assists, Bam Adebayo added 13, and Max Strus scored ten points for the Heat. For Boston, the All-NBA duo of Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown were a no-show, as they combined for just 26 points on 12-of-35 (34%) from the field and 1-of-14 (7%) from three-point range. The Celtics also lacked effort on defense, as they allowed Miami to shoot 57% from the field and 54% from beyond the arc, resulting in a substantial 33-point deficit in the third quarter that prompted head coach Joe Mazzulla to empty his bench for the final 12 minutes.\n Led by Jayson Tatum's 33 points, 11 rebounds, and seven assists, the Celtics fought off elimination and forced the series back to Boston. The Heat initially held a nine-point lead in the second half, but a 48–22 scoring run by Boston in just 14 minutes turned the game in their favor, as Tatum scored 25 of his 33 points in the second half. Jaylen Brown contributed 17 points and Derrick White added 16 points, while Grant Williams, Al Horford, and Marcus Smart each scored in double figures. Jimmy Butler led the Heat's efforts with 29 points and nine rebounds, while Gabe Vincent and Caleb Martin added 17 and 16 points, respectively. The Heat struggled from beyond the arc, shooting 8-of-32 (25%) from deep, while the Celtics made 18-of-45 (40%) three-pointers, creating a significant 30-point difference in scoring from long range. Boston also capitalized on Miami's mistakes, as they scored 27 points off 16 turnovers.\n In front of their home crowd, the Celtics dominated the Heat from the jump, surging to a 23–7 lead that set the tone for the rest of the game as Boston moved two wins away from becoming the first NBA team ever to overcome a 3–0 series deficit. Derrick White scored 24 points and connected on six three-pointers, while Marcus Smart contributed 23 points and five steals. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown each added 21 points as Boston improved to 4–0 in elimination games this postseason. With Gabe Vincent out with an ankle sprain, Miami struggled to find their offensive footing, as the Heat were forced into ten first-half turnovers that led to 17 Boston points. Duncan Robinson led Miami in scoring with 18 points, while Bam Adebayo contributed 16 points and eight rebounds. Jimmy Butler, who had been averaging 30 points this postseason, finished with an underwhelming 14 points as Miami never led.\n With just a mere tenth of a second remaining on the clock, Derrick White emerged as the hero, scoring a crucial putback to secure the win for the Celtics, joining Michael Jordan as the second player in NBA history to hit a buzzer-beater with his team trailing and facing elimination. In addition, Jayson Tatum scored 31 points, Jaylen Brown scored 26, and Marcus Smart added 21 for Boston, who became only the fourth team to erase a 0–3 deficit and force a decisive game 7. For the Heat, the duo of Jimmy Butler and Bam Adebayo went 5-of-30 from the field in the first three quarters, combining for just 18 points. However, trailing by ten with under four minutes to go, Butler scored 13 of his 24 points during a 15–4 run that gave Miami the lead with three seconds left. After a Celtics timeout, White inbounded the ball to Smart, who missed a three-pointer, but White crashed the boards and scored the game-winning tip shot.\n Following their defeat in a decisive seventh game against the Celtics last year, the Heat overcame the setback of squandering a 3–0 series lead to secure their second NBA Finals appearance in four seasons. Caleb Martin, who averaged just 9.6 points in the regular season, scored a playoff career-high 26 points on 11-of-16 shooting, finishing the series averaging 19.3 points. Jimmy Butler scored a game-high 28 points, while Bam Adebayo recorded his seventh double-double of the playoffs as the Heat became the first No. 8 seed to reach the Finals in a full 82-game regular season. The Celtics meanwhile were discombobulated from the start, as they missed their first 12 three-point attempts and finished the game shooting 21% from deep. Derrick White scored 18 for Boston, and Jayson Tatum had 14 points with 11 rebounds after turning his ankle on the first play of the game. Jaylen Brown contributed 19 points and eight rebounds, but shot 1-of-9 from beyond the arc and committed a playoff-high eight turnovers as Boston lost their 12th playoff game at home over the last two postseasons.\nButler was awarded the second annual Eastern Conference finals MVP, averaging 24.7 points, 7.6 rebounds, and 6.1 assists on 42% from the field, 35% from beyond the arc, and 83% from the free-throw line. Had the Celtics won the game, they would have become the first NBA team to overcome the 3–0 series deficit (and second basketball team overall, after the PBA's San Miguel Beermen in the 2015–16 PBA Philippine Cup Finals).\n\nThis was the sixth playoff meeting between the two teams, with the Heat winning three of the first five meetings.\n\nWestern Conference finals\n(1) Denver Nuggets vs. (7) Los Angeles Lakers\nLooking to advance to their first NBA Finals in their 47th season, the Nuggets got off on the right track, as Nikola Jokić recorded his sixth triple-double of the playoffs to propel Denver to a 1–0 series lead. Jokić notched 34 points, 21 rebounds, and 14 assists on 12-of-17 shooting as he outrebounded the Lakers by himself in the first half, 16 to 13. Jokić's performance was backed by his teammates, as five other Denver players finished in double figures, with Jamal Murray scoring 31 points on 60% shooting. For the Lakers, Anthony Davis finished with 40 points, while LeBron James put up 26 points, 12 boards, and nine assists. Los Angeles trailed by as many as 21 but they pulled within three points multiple times in the fourth quarter, with Austin Reaves scoring 11 of his 23 points in the final quarter. However, the Lakers could not fully recover from their slow start, as the Nuggets improved to 7–0 at home this postseason.\n Behind Jamal Murray's 23-point fourth quarter performance, the Nuggets took a commanding 2–0 series lead in the conference finals for the first time in franchise history. Although Murray was 5-of-17 from the field entering the fourth quarter, he shot 6-of-7 from the field and scored 23 of the Nuggets' 32 fourth quarter points. Murray's performance fueled a pivotal 15–1 run that gave Denver a lead they would not relinquish. Nikola Jokić also recorded his 13th playoff triple-double, contributing 23 points, 17 rebounds, and 12 assists as Denver moved to 39–4 at home this season with Jokić on the floor. Meanwhile, Rui Hachimura shot 7-for-7 in the first half and finished with 21 points for the Lakers, while Austin Reaves scored 22 points. However, the star duo of LeBron James and Anthony Davis shot a combined 13-of-34 from the floor, with James going 0-of-10 from beyond the arc in the first two games of the series.\n After the Memphis Grizzlies and Golden State Warriors were both blown out in their first road game against the Lakers, the Nuggets flipped the script, as they handed the Lakers their first home loss since March 26 and moved to the brink of their first NBA Finals appearance. Trailing by one with under eight minutes remaining, the Nuggets orchestrated a decisive 13–0 run, capitalizing on a disciplined team performance that yielded 30 assists to just five turnovers. Jamal Murray picked up where he left off in Game 2, as he scored 30 of his 37 points in the first half, while Nikola Jokić scored 15 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter. Anthony Davis led the Lakers with 28 points and 18 rebounds, LeBron James contributed 23 points and 12 assists, and Austin Reaves contributed 23 points and seven rebounds. However, Los Angeles lacked scoring depth, as Rui Hachimura was the only other player to reach double figures.\n The Nuggets exorcised their playoff demons against the Lakers and advanced to their first NBA Finals in their 47-year history. Denver faced a 15-point halftime deficit but opened the second half on a 36–14 run. Los Angeles tied the game in the closing minutes after erasing a seven-point deficit, but Nikola Jokić's 25-foot fallaway three-pointer and go-ahead layup sealed the Nuggets' first playoff series sweep in franchise history. Jokić broke an NBA playoff record with his eighth triple-double of the playoffs, recording 30 points, 14 rebounds, and 13 assists, while Jamal Murray and Aaron Gordon contributed 25 and 22 points, respectively. LeBron James matched his playoff career-high as a Laker with 40 points, ten boards, and nine assists, as his 31 points in the first half marked the highest-scoring playoff half of his career. However, James missed critical shots, including a potential game-tying shot that was blocked by Gordon in the final seconds. Anthony Davis contributed 21 points and 14 rebounds, and Austin Reaves scored 17 points as the Lakers were swept for the 11th time in team history.\nJokić was awarded the second annual Western Conference finals MVP, averaging 27.8 points, 14.5 rebounds, and 11.8 assists on 51% from the field, 47% from beyond the arc, and 78% from the free-throw line.\n\nThis was the eighth playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Lakers winning the first seven meetings.\n\nNBA Finals: (W1) Denver Nuggets vs. (E8) Miami Heat\nNote: Times are EDT (UTC−4) as listed by the NBA.

Each finals since that year either included both the Celtics and the Heat, or neither team.\nThe Mavericks returned to the Western Conference finals after missing the previous playoffs.\nThe Pacers advanced to the Eastern Conference finals for the first time since 2014.\nThe Timberwolves advanced to the Western Conference finals for just the second time in team history, and the first time since 2004.\nThe average age of the leading scorer for each team remaining (Tatum, Haliburton, Edwards, and Dončić for the Celtics, Pacers, Timberwolves, and Mavericks respectively) was 24.62, the youngest in a conference finals since 1971.\nGame 1 vs the Pacers was the first time in Celtics' franchise history that three of its players (Tatum, Brown, and Holiday) scored 25 or more points in a Conference Finals game.\nDereck Lively II became the first player in NBA history to record a perfect 16/16 (100 percent) from the field in a playoff series. He surpassed Chris Andersen 's previous record of 13/13 FG made at 2013 Eastern Conference Semifinals series.\nThis was the third instance (following the 2015 and 2023 playoffs) where both conference finals series had teams go up 3–0 in the series. Just like in 2015, the Celtics would go on to complete the sweep in the East, while the Timberwolves would successfully force a game 5 in the West but fell short.\nThis was also the second time that the Indiana Pacers and the Minnesota Timberwolves were runner-ups in their respective conference finals, the last occurrence being in 2004.\n\nNBA Finals\nThis was the first time the Dallas Mavericks played a team other than the Miami Heat in the NBA Finals, having lost to Miami in 2006 and won against them in 2011.\nThe Mavericks became the second #5 seed in NBA history to make the finals, joining the 2019–20 Miami Heat.\nLuka Dončić became the first player to lead all players in points, rebounds and assists entering the NBA Finals.\nThe Dallas Mavericks' 38-point lead over the Boston Celtics (122–84) in game 4 of the Finals was the third largest margin of victory in NBA Finals history.\nTim Hardaway Jr. joined Ray Allen and Stephen Curry as the only three players to score five or more three-pointers in a single quarter of an NBA Finals game.\n\nFormat\nEight teams from each conference participated in the playoffs. The top six teams in each conference, based on winning percentage, directly qualified for the playoffs; the seeding order of those teams was also based on winning percentage. If two or more teams had the same record, standard NBA tiebreaker rules were used.\nThe NBA Board of Governors adopted a format starting in 2021 to have a play-in tournament involving the teams ranked 7th through 10th in each conference. The 7th place team and 8th place team participated in a \"double-chance\" game, with the winner advancing to the playoffs as the 7-seed. The loser then played the winner of the elimination game between the 9th place and 10th place teams to determine the playoff's 8-seed. The NBA's regular playoff format then proceeded as normal.\nEach conference's bracket was fixed with no reseeding. All rounds were a best-of-seven series; a series ended when one team won four games, and that team advanced to the next round. All rounds, including the NBA Finals, were in a 2–2–1–1–1 format with regards to hosting. In the conference playoffs, home-court advantage went to the higher-seeded team (number one being the highest). For the NBA Finals, home-court advantage went to the team with the better regular season record, and, if needed, ties were broken based on head-to-head record, followed by intra-conference record.\n\nPlayoff qualifying\nOn March 14, 2024, the Boston Celtics became the first team to clinch a playoff spot. While noted in the below tables, division titles have no bearing on seeding.\nSeeds 7 and 8 in each conference were determined via the first-stage play-in tournament, held April 16–19.\n\nEastern Conference\nChicago (39–43) and Atlanta (36–46) also secured play-in berths but did not advance to the playoffs.\n\nWestern Conference\nSacramento (46–36) and Golden State (46–36) also secured play-in berths but did not advance to the playoffs.\n\nPlay-in tournament brackets\nEastern Conference\nBold Game winner\nItalic Team with home-court advantage\n\nWestern Conference\nBold Game winner\nItalic Team with home-court advantage\n\nBracket\nTeams in bold advanced to the next round. The numbers to the left of each team indicate the team's seeding in its conference, and the numbers to the right indicate the number of games the team won in that round. The division champions are marked by an asterisk. Teams with home court advantage, the higher seeded team, are shown in italics.\n\nFirst round\nNote: Times are EDT (UTC−4) as listed by the NBA. If the venue is located in a different time zone, the local time is also given.\n\nEastern Conference first round\n(1) Boston Celtics vs. (8) Miami Heat\nJayson Tatum recorded his first playoff triple-double, leading the Celtics to a 114–94 Game 1 victory over the defending Eastern Conference champion Miami Heat. Tatum's performance of 23 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists was complemented by his teammates, as they knocked down 21 of Boston's 22 three-pointers. Derrick White added 20 points and four assists for Boston, which finished with six players in double-figures. The Heat, who were without Jimmy Butler and Terry Rozier, never held a lead and trailed by as much as 34 points.

Jaylen Brown scored 33 points for the Celtics, who lost just their fifth home game of the season, while Jayson Tatum scored 28. Boston newcomers Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porziņģis combined for 15 points and shot 5-of-21 from the field, with Porziņģis finishing with a plus–minus of –32 in a 10-point loss.\n The top-seeded Celtics responded emphatically to their home loss with a wire-to-wire 104–84 victory over the Heat, retaking the series lead. Led by Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown's 22 points each, the Celtics improved upon their defense and held Miami to a season-low 84 points. Tatum also contributed 11 rebounds and six assists, while Kristaps Porziņģis and Derrick White added 18 and 16 points respectively. The Heat, who trailed by as much as 29, struggled to find an offensive rhythm, with Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro combining on 13-of-34 (38%) from the field.

For the Heat, Bam Adebayo recorded a double-double with 25 points and 17 rebounds, while Tyler Herro recorded 19 points and five turnovers. Despite a 4-of-8 three-point shooting night from Caleb Martin, the rest of the Heat shot 5-of-25 from deep, as they managed under 90 points for the second consecutive game.\n The Celtics dominated the game from start to finish, winning every quarter and blowing out the Heat for a 4–1 series win. Derrick White scored 25 points, including 5 3-pointers. Jaylen Brown also contributed 25 points, while Jayson Tatum completed a double-double with 16 points and 12 rebounds. Sam Hauser came off the bench and shot 5-of-8 from beyond the arc en route to 17 points. The Heat endured a hard time on the offensive end, making just 3 3-pointers in 29 attempts, along with an overall field goal percentage of 41.4%, as they were limited to below 90 points for the third straight game. Bam Adebayo led the scoring for them, notching 23 points in the losing effort.\n\nThis was the seventh playoff meeting between the two teams, with the Heat winning four of the first six meetings.\n\n(2) New York Knicks vs. (7) Philadelphia 76ers\nWith the Knicks' starters struggling, the New York bench outscored the 76ers' bench 42–7, with Miles McBride, Bojan Bogdanović and Mitchell Robinson leading the way to win Game 1.

A hobbled Joel Embiid scored 29 points, alongside eight rebounds and six assists, while Tyrese Maxey had a game-high 33 points.

After Kyle Lowry missed his second free throw, Jalen Brunson, who was previously 7-for-28 from the field and 0-of-5 from beyond the arc, hit a three-pointer that bounced on the rim and dropped in. Following the inbound to Tyrese Maxey, Josh Hart stole the ball and kicked it out to Donte DiVincenzo, who missed a three-pointer, but an offensive rebound by Isaiah Hartenstein found the ball back in DiVincenzo's hands, who drained a go-ahead three with 13 seconds left. Maxey then missed a driving layup, New York made two free throws, and the Knicks secured the victory after Joel Embiid's three-point attempt missed at the buzzer. Maxey, battling flu-like symptoms, tallied 35 points, 10 assists, and nine rebounds, while Embiid finished with 34 points and 10 rebounds.\n After vowing the 76ers were “going to win this series”, Joel Embiid scored a playoff career-high 50 points, with 18 of them coming in a decisive third quarter to win 125–114. Embiid, who's been battling Bell's palsy, was 13-of-19 from the floor, made 19-of-21 free throws, and hit five three-pointers, with four of them coming during Philadelphia's 43–27 third quarter. Tyrese Maxey finished with 25 points, and Kelly Oubre Jr. had 15 points on 75% shooting. Jalen Brunson led the Knicks with 39 points and 13 assists on an improved 48% from the field, while Josh Hart and OG Anunoby recorded 20 and 17 points, respectively.

Brunson shot 18-of-34 from the field and finished with an assist-turnover ratio of 10 to 1, as he surpassed the 46 points scored by Bernard King in 1984. Josh Hart had zero field goals but finished with a playoff career-high 17 rebounds, while OG Anunoby had a double-double of 16 points and 14 boards.

Tyrese Maxey scored 23 and Kelly Oubre Jr. had 19 points as the Sixers shot 29-of-82 (35%) from the floor, their second-lowest percentage of the season.\n Trailing by six with under 30 seconds and facing elimination, Tyrese Maxey converted a four-point play and hit a 35-foot game-tying three to force overtime and save the 76ers' season. Maxey finished with a playoff career-high 46 points and nine assists on 57% shooting,  while Joel Embiid, who shot 7-of-19 from the field and committed nine turnovers, recorded his first playoff triple-double. Jalen Brunson had his second straight 40-point game and scored all nine of the Knicks' overtime points, but committed a crucial turnover in the waning seconds.

Jalen Brunson led the Knicks with 41 points and 12 assists on 13-of-27 shots alongside 12-of-16 free throws, his third-straight 40-point game. Hart had a double-double with 16 points and 14 rebounds, while Donte DiVincenzo added 23 points for New York. For Philadelphia, Joel Embiid recorded 39 points and 13 rebounds on 12-of-25 shots, although he committed five turnovers and fouled out in the final seconds of the game. Tyrese Maxey had 17 points on 6-of-18 shots, while Tobias Harris failed to score in 29 minutes of play. Off the bench, Buddy Hield added 20 points for Philadelphia, but he overshot a potential game-tying three-pointer at the end of the game.\n\nThis was the tenth playoff meeting between these two teams, and the fifth since the Syracuse Nationals relocated to Philadelphia in 1963, with the 76ers winning six of the first nine meetings.\n\n(3) Milwaukee Bucks vs. (6) Indiana Pacers\nIn his first playoff game in three years, Damian Lillard scored all 35 of his points in the first half to give the Bucks a 27-point halftime lead and ultimately secure a 1–0 series advantage without Giannis Antetokounmpo.

Trailing 49–31 midway through the second quarter, Cleveland rallied behind Donovan Mitchell, who finished with 39 points and nine rebounds on 41% from the field.

If the venue is located in a different time zone, the local time is also given.\n\nEastern Conference finals\n(1) Boston Celtics vs. (6) Indiana Pacers\nIn a matchup between the top two scoring teams from the regular season, the Celtics rallied behind Jayson Tatum's 36 points and Jaylen Brown's clutch three-pointer to secure the series opener in overtime. Boston opened the game on a 12–0 run, but the Pacers fought back and eventually led by three with 10 seconds remaining. However, Indiana turned it over after failing to inbound the ball, and Brown hit a contested three-pointer to tie the game at 117. Tatum, who also finished with 12 rebounds and four assists, then orchestrated a personal 6–0 run in overtime to put the Celtics ahead for good. Brown finished with 26 points, Jrue Holiday scored a season-high 28 points, and Derrick White dished out nine assists. The Pacers had seven players finish in double figures, but struggled with 22 turnovers, which led to 32 points for Boston. Tyrese Haliburton recorded 25 points and 10 assists, while Pascal Siakam and Myles Turner combined for 47 points and 22 rebounds.\n After losing game 2 at home against the Miami Heat and Cleveland Cavaliers, the Celtics, behind Jaylen Brown's 40 points, protected their home court to take a commanding 2–0 series lead. Brown, matching his playoff career-high and shooting 14-of-27 from the field, spearheaded a 20–0 run in the first half that gave Boston a lead they never relinquished. The Pacers closed the gap to two points in the third quarter, but the Celtics countered with a 16–5 run to maintain a double-digit lead. Jayson Tatum and Derrick White each scored 23 points, while Jrue Holiday shot 6-of-7 from the field and dished out 10 assists. Pascal Siakam led Indiana with 28 points on 13-of-17 shooting, while Tyrese Haliburton had 10 points and eight assists before departing in the third quarter with hamstring soreness. Andrew Nembhard provided 16 points, but center Myles Turner finished with eight points, four rebounds, and four turnovers.\n Trailing by eight with under 2:30 remaining, the Celtics closed the game on a 13–2 run and moved one win away from their second NBA Finals appearance in three seasons. After trailing by as much as 18 in the third quarter, Jrue Holiday gave Boston their first lead of the second half with a three-point play in the final minute, followed by a crucial steal and two free throws to secure the victory. Jayson Tatum had 36 points, 10 rebounds, eight assists, and zero turnovers. Jaylen Brown added 24 points, and Al Horford made 7-of-12 three-pointers. Derrick White also tallied four blocks and seven assists as the Celtics improved to 5–0 on the road this postseason and snapped the Pacers' 11-game home winning streak. Without All-Star Tyrese Haliburton, Andrew Nembhard scored a career-high 32 points and nine assists, T. J. McConnell added 23 points and nine rebounds, and both Pascal Siakam and Myles Turner scored 22 points.\n The Celtics' 7–0 run in the final 3:30 secured their first sweep in the conference finals since 1986 and their 23rd NBA finals appearance in franchise history. Derrick White, previously struggling with his three-point shooting (1-for-8), knocked down a game-winning three-pointer with 44 seconds left, finishing with 16 points, five steals, and three blocks. After a missed three-pointer from Andrew Nembhard with 31 seconds remaining, the Pacers forced Jayson Tatum into a missed shot, but an offensive rebound by Jrue Holiday, who finished with 17 points and nine boards, secured the Celtics' seventh consecutive playoff win. Jaylen Brown finished with 29 points and three steals, while Tatum posted 26 points, 13 rebounds, and eight assists. Indiana, missing Tyrese Haliburton for the second straight game, dropped to 1–8 all-time in the conference finals and was swept despite holding a lead or being tied in the final minute in three of the four games this series. Nembhard tallied 24 points and 10 assists, Pascal Siakam notched a double-double, and T. J. McConnell produced 15 points off the bench.\nBrown was awarded the third annual Eastern Conference finals MVP, averaging 29.8 points, 5.0 rebounds, and 2.0 steals on 51.7% from the field, 37% from beyond the arc, and 65.5% from the free-throw line.\n\nThis was the seventh playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Celtics winning four of the first six meetings.\n\nWestern Conference finals\n(3) Minnesota Timberwolves vs. (5) Dallas Mavericks\nKyrie Irving scored 24 of his 30 points in the first half, and Luka Dončić delivered 15 of his 33 points in the fourth quarter to lead the Mavericks to a 1–0 series lead. In a back-and-forth contest, Dallas trailed by four with under 3:30 remaining, but a decisive 8–0 run over the next three minutes, highlighted by a go-ahead three-pointer by P. J. Washington, secured the victory. Despite a dismal 6-of-25 (24%) three-point shooting night, the Mavericks dominated the paint 62–38 and made 16-of-17 free throws, compared to 61% from the Timberwolves. Rookie Dereck Lively II had 11 boards on 4-of-4 shooting, while Dončić tallied eight assists and three steals. For Minnesota, Jaden McDaniels made 6-of-9 three-pointers and recorded over 20 points for the third consecutive game, but Anthony Edwards and Karl-Anthony Towns struggled to find their rhythm, combining for 35 points on 12-of-36 (33%) from the field.\n Luka Dončić recorded his fourth triple-double in five games and drained a game-winning three-pointer over the Defensive Player of the Year (Rudy Gobert), securing a 2–0 series lead for the Mavericks. Trailing by as much as 18 late in the second quarter, the Mavericks shot 60.5% from the floor (23-for-38) after halftime, with Kyrie Irving scoring 13 of his 20 points in the fourth quarter. Dončić's 13 assists primarily went to centers Daniel Gafford and Dereck Lively II, who combined for 30 points on 14-of-16 shooting. Following Dončić's go-ahead three with 3.0 seconds left, Naz Reid, who was previously 7-of-8 from deep, missed a potential buzzer-beating three for the Timberwolves. Gobert notched a double-double, while Mike Conley added 18 points, but the All-Star duo of Edwards and Towns continued to struggle, as they combined to shoot 9-for-33 (27%) from the field, with Towns benched during the fourth quarter.\n For the third consecutive game, Luka Dončić and Kyrie Irving delivered in the clutch for the Mavericks, finishing with 33 points each and leading a decisive 14–3 run to conclude the game as Dallas took a commanding 3–0 series lead. Dončić and Irving outscored the Timberwolves in the fourth quarter 21–20, as the duo shot 8-of-10 from the field. Dončić also recorded five steals, while P. J. Washington contributed 16 points, eight rebounds, and a go-ahead three-pointer for the Mavericks, who shot 14-of-28 from beyond the arc and 55.9% from the field. Anthony Edwards finished with 26 points, nine boards, and nine assists on an improved 11-of-24 shooting for Minnesota, but took just three shot attempts in the final quarter. Mike Conley and Jaden McDaniels added 16 and 15 points, respectively, while Karl-Anthony Towns shot 0-of-8 from deep, lowering his series three-point shooting percentage to 13.6% (3-for-22).\n On the verge of getting swept, the Timberwolves staved off elimination when Karl-Anthony Towns scored 20 of his 25 points in the second half and knocked down three critical three-pointers down the stretch to force a game 5 in Minneapolis. Anthony Edwards had 29 points, 10 rebounds, and nine assists, while Towns, previously shooting 28% from the field in the series, finished 9-of-13 from the floor and 4-of-5 from beyond the arc. Rudy Gobert recorded another double-double, and Mike Conley tallied 14 points and four steals for Minnesota, who shot 58% in the second half. Daniel Gafford had three blocks on 6-of-6 shooting for the Mavericks, who were without Dereck Lively II due to a head injury from the previous game. Luka Dončić logged 28 points, 15 boards, and 10 assists for his sixth triple-double this postseason, but he and Kyrie Irving shot an inefficient 13-of-39 (33%) from the field, with Irving losing his first closeout game after previously being 14–0.\n Luka Dončić outscored the Timberwolves by himself 20-19 in the first quarter, as Dallas blew out Minnesota to secure their third finals appearance in franchise history, and their first in 13 years. Dončić and Kyrie Irving scored 36 points each on 28-of-49 (57%) from the field as the Mavericks went on a 28-5 run in the first half, building a commanding 69-40 lead by halftime. In his return, Dereck Lively II recorded 8 rebounds, 3 blocks and made all three of his shots, finishing the series with a perfect 16-of-16 shooting. Daniel Gafford and P. J. Washington combined for 23 points. For Minnesota, Anthony Edwards and Karl-Anthony Towns scored 28 points each on a combined 19-of-38 (50%) from the field. Towns recorded a double-double with 12 rebounds, but the rest of Minnesota's starters (Gobert, Conley, and McDaniels) only combined for 24 points. Naz Reid performed poorly with 5 points on 2-of-10 from the field, missing all four of this three-point attempts and led the Timberwolves with three turnovers.\nDončić was awarded the third annual Western Conference finals MVP, averaging 32.4 points, 9.6 rebounds, and 8.2 assists on 47.3% from the field, 43.4% from beyond the arc, and 84.6% from the free-throw line.\n\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the Mavericks winning the first meeting.\n\nNBA Finals: (E1) Boston Celtics vs. (W5) Dallas Mavericks\nNote: Times are EDT (UTC−4) as listed by the NBA.

    "Clutch City": "Clutch City is a nickname given to the city of Houston, Texas after the city's National Basketball Association (NBA) club, the Houston Rockets.\n\nBackground\n\"Choke City\" was a Houston Chronicle front-page headline in 1994, given to the city of Houston after the Houston Rockets blew two consecutive commanding fourth-quarter leads at The Summit in the first two games of their Western Conference semifinals match-up versus the Phoenix Suns in the 1994 NBA Playoffs. This in effect took the series to Phoenix, Arizona down 0–2 in the best-of-seven series. It was feared at the time that the Rockets would follow the same fate as the city's National Football League (NFL) club at the time, the Houston Oilers; the Oilers blew a 32-point lead during a January 3, 1993 NFL playoff game versus the Buffalo Bills; the Bills won the game 41–38 in overtime. The following year, the Oilers took an 11-game winning streak into the postseason. After a first-round bye, they drew the Kansas City Chiefs at home. After leading for much of the game, the Oilers would ultimately squander a 10-point lead at home to Joe Montana and the Chiefs, leading to a 28–20 upset. The Houston Astros had similar playoff heartbreaks: in the decisive Game 5 of the 1980 National League Championship Series, the Astros had a 5–2 lead going into the 8th inning over the Philadelphia Phillies at the Astrodome, six outs away from making their first World Series. The Phillies however would score 5 runs in the 8th and win 8–7 in extra innings. In the Game 6 of the 1986 National League Championship Series against the New York Mets, the Mets held a 3–2 series lead while the Astros looked to send it to a Game 7 with Cy Young pitcher Mike Scott waiting in the wings. Houston led by three for most of the game, until New York scored three runs of their own to tie it in the top of the 9th and sent the game to extra innings, eventually prevailing 7–6 in 16 innings at the Astrodome. During this era, no Houston-based professional sports team from an existing sports league (the NFL, NBA, or Major League Baseball) had won a championship.\n\n1993–1994 season\nIn Rudy Tomjanovich's second full season as head coach, the Rockets began the 1993–94 season by tying an NBA record with start of 15–0. Led by Hakeem Olajuwon, who was named the MVP and Defensive Player of the Year, the Rockets won a franchise-record 58 games. The Rockets in the second round of the playoffs recovered from losing the first two games at home to the Phoenix Suns in the second round of the playoffs after blowing multiple big leads in the first two games, eventually winning in seven games to advance to the NBA Finals. This series is widely regarded as the birth of the term nickname \"Clutch City\". Houston once again went down by three games to two to the New York Knicks, but managed to win the last two games on their home court, and claim their first championship in franchise history, of which at the end of Game 6 Olajuwon blocked a championship-winning 3-point shot attempt by John Starks, forcing a Game 7. Olajuwon was awarded the Finals MVP, after averaging 27 points, nine rebounds and four blocked shots per game.\n\n1994–1995 season\nThe Rockets initially struggled in the first half of the 1994–95 season, and ended up winning only 47 games, which was 11 games lower than their previous year's total. In a midseason trade with Portland, the Rockets obtained guard Clyde Drexler, a former teammate of Olajuwon at the University of Houston, in exchange for Otis Thorpe. Houston entered the playoffs as the sixth seed in the Western Conference, but managed to defeat the 60–22 Utah Jazz in the first round, winning the last two games after being down 2-1 including the decisive Game 5 road win. They fell behind 3–1 to the 59–23 Phoenix Suns in the second round, but won three straight to win the series, and became only the first team in NBA history to overcome both a 2–0 and a 3–1 series deficit in a seven-game series during the same postseason. The Rockets then beat the 62-20 San Antonio Spurs in the conference finals, to reach the Finals against the Orlando Magic, led by Shaquille O'Neal and Anfernee \"Penny\" Hardaway. When Houston swept the series in four straight games, they became the first team in NBA history to win the championship as a sixth seed, and the first to beat four 50-win teams in a single postseason en route to the championship. Olajuwon, who had averaged 35.3 points and 12.5 rebounds against the Spurs and regular-season MVP David Robinson in the conference finals, was named the Finals MVP, becoming only the second player after Michael Jordan to win the award two years consecutively. Shaquille O'Neal (00–02), Kobe Bryant (09–10),  LeBron James (12–13) and Kevin Durant (17–18) have since accomplished this.\n\nUsage in other Houston sports\nThe name Clutch City would be used by the city's Major League Baseball (MLB) club (the Houston Astros) after their first World Series appearance in 2005, and by the city's Major League Soccer (MLS) club (the Houston Dynamo) after they won the MLS Cup in their inaugural season in 2006.  The name Clutch City was also associated with the Houston Aeros and their triumphant march to the Calder Cup Finals – the biggest stage in AHL hockey.\nOne variation of the name was Crush City, which was used in 2015 to support the Astros in their playoff run.\nThe Houston Rockets used the brand name Clutch Gaming for their League of Legends Championship Series team.\nNFL on CBS announcer Ian Eagle also referenced the nickname, after the Houston Texans defeated the Buffalo Bills during the 2024 season by a game-winning 59-yard field goal by kicker Kaʻimi Fairbairn.\n\nSee also\nNicknames of Houston\nList of city nicknames in Texas\nCulture of Houston\nClutch, the mascot of the Houston Rockets, unveiled after their 1994 NBA Championship.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nROCKETS: 1994: From Choke City to Clutch City",
    "NBA conference finals": "The NBA conference finals are the Eastern and Western Conference championship series of the National Basketball Association (NBA), a professional basketball league in North America. The NBA was founded in 1946 as the Basketball Association of America (BAA). The NBA adopted its current name at the start of the 1949–50 season when the BAA merged with the National Basketball League (NBL). The league currently consists of 30 teams, of which 29 are located in the United States and 1 in Canada. Each team plays 82 games in the regular season. After the regular season, eight teams from each of the league's two conferences qualify for the playoffs. At the end of the playoffs, the top two teams play each other in the conference finals, to determine the conference champions from each side, who then proceed to play in the NBA Finals. Trophies were given to each conference winner starting in 2001. In 2022, the league started naming an NBA Conference Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) for each conference.\n\nOverview\nInitially, the BAA teams were aligned into the Eastern Division and the Western Division. The Divisional Finals were first played in 1949, the league's third season. The first two seasons used a playoffs format where Eastern and Western Division teams would face each other before the BAA Finals. Hence, there were no divisional finals. In the 1949–50 season, the league realigned itself to three divisions, with the addition of the Central Division. However, the arrangement was only used for one season, and the league returned to the two-division format in 1951. The two divisions' format remained until 1970 when the NBA realigned itself into two conferences with two divisions each, which led to the renaming to conference finals. \nThe finals were a best-of-3 series from 1949 to 1950, a best-of-5 series from 1951 to 1956, and a best-of-7 series since 1957. The conference finals are currently played in a best-of-7 series like the NBA playoffs and Finals. The two series are played in late May each year after the first and second rounds of the Playoffs and before the Finals. After the conference finals, winners are presented with a silver trophy, caps, and T-shirts and advance to the NBA Finals.\nThe Los Angeles Lakers have won the most conference titles with 19. They have also made 24 appearances in the conference finals, more than any other team, which included eight consecutive appearances in the Western Conference finals from 1982 to 1989. The Boston Celtics have won 11 conference championships, the second most of any team. 23 of the 30 active franchises have won at least one conference title. The Minnesota Timberwolves, Atlanta Hawks, Sacramento Kings, Memphis Grizzlies and Los Angeles Clippers have each played in at least one conference finals, but have failed to win their respective conference title. Two other franchises, the Charlotte Hornets and New Orleans Pelicans, have never appeared in the conference finals.\n\nConference trophies\nThe NBA first awarded conference championship trophies in 2001. In 2022, both were redesigned, and named the Bob Cousy Trophy for the Eastern Conference and the Oscar Robertson Trophy for the Western Conference, in honor of two men who were instrumental in developing and advancing the players' labor union, the National Basketball Players Association. The two redesigned trophies each feature a silver basketball with its respective conference finals logo on the underside. The trophies also have a slightly different base for each conference to help distinguish one from the other; the silver basketball on the Eastern Conference trophy sits on three pegs, while the Western Conference trophy has the basketball on intercrossing circular rings. The silver basketball is quartered into four sections, representing the winning team first qualifying for the playoffs and then advancing through the three playoff rounds. In that same year, the NBA began awarding Conference Finals MVPs to the best-performing player of each Conference Finals: the Larry Bird Eastern Conference Finals Most Valuable Player Award and the Magic Johnson Western Conference Finals Most Valuable Player Award, named for the two players credited for building the league up to greater popularity in the 1980s. The MVP trophies follow a design similar to that of the Bill Russell NBA Finals MVP trophy, only smaller, and the ball on each trophy is silver, instead of gold, and follows the Conference Championship trophies in how it sits on the base.\n\nKey\nConference\nEastern Conference finals\nWestern Conference finals\nResults by team\nStats updated through May 30, 2024\n\nTotal number of appearances\nYears of appearance\nIn the sortable table below, teams are ordered first by number of appearances, then by number of wins, and finally by year of first appearance.

    "List of NBA franchise postseason droughts": "This is a list of National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise post-season appearance droughts. This list includes the all-time and the active consecutive non-playoffs. Aside from the NBA playoff appearance droughts, this list also includes droughts of series wins, appearances in the NBA Finals and NBA championship wins. The oldest franchise to never win the championship is the Suns (54 seasons), while the Royals/Kings and the Hawks have even longer championship droughts (71 and 64 seasons, respectively). Five franchises have never been to the NBA Finals, tied with the National Hockey League for the highest number among the major North American sports. The oldest such team is the Braves/Clippers franchise (52 seasons); the Kings and the Hawks have appearance droughts that are even longer (71 and 61 seasons, respectively). The longest a franchise has gone without appearing in the playoffs at all is 16 seasons: the Kings franchise from 2006 to 2023.\nOf the 20 franchises that have won an NBA championship, 7 have droughts of 41 seasons or more, which is to say that the past 40 championships have been shared among only 13 franchises: the Lakers (9), Bulls (6), Spurs (5), Warriors (4), Pistons (3), Celtics (3), Heat (3), Rockets (2), Mavericks (1), Cavaliers (1), Raptors (1), Bucks (1), and Nuggets (1).

    "List of teams that have overcome 2–0 series deficits in a best-of-five series": "The following is the list of teams that have overcome 2–0 series deficits in a best-of-five series concerning North American professional sports, otherwise known as a reverse sweep. The listed teams won three consecutive games after being down 2–0 in a best-of-five playoff series. Unsuccessful comebacks are also listed here, in which teams evened a series after being behind 2–0, then lost the final game of the series.\nThe best-of-five playoff structure used to be common in North American professional sports, particularly in the sports of baseball, basketball, and ice hockey. As of 2024, Major League Baseball, the Women's National Basketball Association, and the Professional Women's Hockey League use the format.\nAll 2–0 deficit comebacks in a five-game series involve winning three straight elimination games, finally featuring a double-elimination game five. Longer series of this nature are almost always structured as single-elimination knockout tournaments, so one more loss means losing the series and ending playoff contention for the losing side.\nThis is similar to a comeback from a 3–1 series deficit in a best-of-seven playoff series, which also requires winning three straight games, but these are not covered here. In addition, 2–0 deficit comebacks in the best-of-seven series are also not covered here.\n\nBackground\nThree major North American professional sports leagues have had playoff series throughout their history that can reach a winner-take-all fifth game: Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association (NBA), and the National Hockey League (NHL). Currently, however, only the MLB is actively using best-of-five series, with the best-of-five series that were used in the NHL and NBA being permanently expanded to best-of-seven series in 1987 and 2003, respectively. In the history of these leagues, teams that were down 2–0 in a series have come back to win the series 17 times; 10 times in MLB, 6 times in the NBA, and once in the NHL. The most recent instance was accomplished by the New York Yankees of the MLB in the 2017 American League Division Series.\nIn women's North American professional sports, the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) has used the format for its Finals since 2005 and for the semifinals since 2016, but with no successful 2–0 deficit comebacks to date. The Professional Women's Hockey League (PHWL) has also used the format for its semifinals and Walter Cup Finals since its 2023–24 inaugural season, with one successful comeback: PWHL Minnesota in the 2024 Walter Cup Semifinals.\nOne common comeback scenario is where a heavy favorite digs themselves into a deep hole on early adversity, before reasserting their dominance over a weaker opponent when the chips are down. This explains in part why these comebacks are rare in most sports: powerhouse teams most capable of mounting a comeback don't usually dig themselves into this predicament in the first place.\nAdditionally, over a longer series, teams adapt to the strengths and weaknesses of their opponent (more so than in regular season play); stronger teams are usually better at making these adjustments, which makes a \"Cinderella\" comeback by the weaker team that much more difficult to pull off. In team sports where an individual position has the potential for outsize impact (e.g. a starting pitcher in baseball or a goalie in hockey), a comeback can sometimes be leveraged by a weaker team off of a heroic individual performance.\n\nKey\nNational Hockey League\nThe Stanley Cup Finals was played as a best-of-five in 1928 and again from 1931 to 1938. Also played as a best-of-five, was a Semi-Final series, which was contested between the top two seeds in the league from 1929 to 1938. From 1980 to 1986, the first round of the playoffs was played as a best-of-five until it was expanded to a best-of-seven starting with the 1987 playoffs. In 2020, the qualifying round was played as a best-of-five as part of the modified playoff format due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSuccessful comebacks\nOnly one team has ever overcome a 2–0 deficit in NHL playoff history.\n\nUnsuccessful comebacks\nFive teams have evened a best-of-five series after falling behind 2–0, only to lose game five.\n\nMajor League Baseball\nFrom 1969 to 1984, the League Championship Series was a best-of-five, until it was expanded to a best-of-seven in 1985. Since its inception in 1994 (and its one-off use in 1981), the League Division series has used the best-of-five format.\n\nSuccessful comebacks\nTen teams have overcome a 2–0 deficit in a best-of-five series, two of which occurred in the League Championship Series.\n\nUnsuccessful comebacks\nSeven teams have evened a best-of-five series after falling behind 2–0, only to lose game five, only one of which occurred in the League Championship Series.\n\nNational Basketball Association\nThe NBA used a best-of-five playoff from 1951 to 1953 and from 1955 to 1957 for the second round of the playoffs, before it was expanded to a best-of-seven starting in 1958. A best-of-five playoff was also used in the first round from 1961 to 1967 and from 1984 to 2002 before it was also expanded to a best-of-seven starting in 2003.\n\nSuccessful comebacks\nSix teams have overcome a 2–0 deficit in NBA playoff history.\n\nUnsuccessful comebacks\nNineteen teams have evened a best-of-five series after falling behind 2–0, only to lose game five.\n\nWomen’s National Basketball Association\nThe WNBA has used a best-of-five series for the WNBA finals for every season from 2005 to 2024 and for the semifinals since 2016.\n\nSuccessful comebacks\nSimilar to how no team in the NBA has overcome a 3–0 deficit in a best-of-seven series, no team in the WNBA has overcome a 2–0 deficit in a best-of-five.\n\nUnsuccessful comebacks\nOnly one team in WNBA history has forced a game five after trailing 2–0, which the team failed to win.\n\nProfessional Women's Hockey League\nThe PWHL uses best-of-five series for the playoff semifinals and the Walter Cup Finals.\n\nSuccessful comebacks\nIn the PWHL's inaugural season, PWHL Minnesota overcame a 2–0 deficit to defeat PWHL Toronto 3 games to 2.\n\nSee also\nList of teams that have overcome 3–1 series deficits\nList of teams that have overcome 3–0 series deficits\n\n\n== References ==",
    "List of teams that have overcome 3–0 series deficits": "The following is the list of teams that have overcome 3–0 series deficits in a best-of-seven playoff series, otherwise known as a reverse sweep. The listed teams won four consecutive games after losing the first three. Unsuccessful comebacks are also listed, in which teams evened a series after being behind 3–0, then lost game seven of the series.\n\nBackground\nThree major North American professional sports leagues have playoff series that can reach a seventh game: Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association (NBA), and the National Hockey League (NHL). In MLB, only the semi-final League Championship Series and the final World Series are best-of-seven series. In the NBA and NHL, all four rounds of their respective playoffs are best-of-seven series.\nIn the history of these leagues, teams that were down 3–0 in a series have come back to win the series five times; four times in the NHL and once in MLB. The most recent example is the Los Angeles Kings of the NHL in the 2014 Stanley Cup playoffs first round. The only instance in the MLB to date was by the Boston Red Sox in the 2004 American League Championship Series. The only instance in a championship series was by the NHL's Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1942 Stanley Cup Finals. The NBA is the only league in which this has never happened, to date.\nConversely, eleven teams have evened a series after being behind 3–0 and then lost in the final game: six in the NHL, four in the NBA, and one in MLB. The most recent example is the Edmonton Oilers of the NHL in the 2024 Stanley Cup Finals.\nNo team has overcome multiple 3–0 deficits in a single postseason, although the 1974–75 New York Islanders of the NHL nearly did so; they successfully overcame a 3–0 series deficit in the 1975 Stanley Cup quarterfinals, then rallied from a 3–0 series deficit in the Stanley Cup semifinals before losing the seventh game.\nWhile, traditionally, a best-of-seven series was only played in the final (championship) round of a postseason, MLB adopted a best-of-seven format in 1985 for the League Championship Series, the NHL followed suit for its first round in 1987, and the NBA did the same for its first round in 2003.\nOutside of the noted major North American leagues, various other leagues across multiple sports also use seven-game postseason series. There are several known instances of teams in such leagues overcoming 3–0 series deficits. In other cases, like the Swedish Hockey League, seven-game series are common but no team has yet overcome such a deficit.\n\nKey\nNational Hockey League\nSuccessful comebacks\nIn Stanley Cup Playoffs history, 211 teams faced a 3–0 deficit in a best-of-seven series. Of these teams, only four overcame the deficit (~2%). Only one overcame the deficit in the Stanley Cup Finals. Three comebacks were completed with game seven away, while the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs completed the comeback on home ice.\n\nUnsuccessful comebacks\nSix other NHL teams have evened a series after being down 3–0, only to lose game seven (~3%). Five of these teams were the visiting team in game seven, while the 1945 Detroit Red Wings were the only home team in game seven.\n\nMajor League Baseball\nSuccessful comebacks\nOne MLB team has overcome a 3–0 deficit to win the series.\n\nUnsuccessful comebacks\nOne MLB team has evened a series after being down 3–0, but lost game seven.\n\nNational Basketball Association\nUnsuccessful comebacks\nThere has never been a successful comeback from a 3–0 series deficit in the NBA to date. Of the 157 NBA teams (as of June 17, 2024) that faced a 3–0 deficit, only 4 of them (~3%) forced a game seven which they ultimately lost.\n\nOther leagues\nOutside of MLB, the NBA, and the NHL, there are some other known instances of successful comebacks from 3–0 series deficits. The Slovak ice hockey club HK Dukla Trenčín and the Swiss ice hockey club EV Zug are the only teams that managed to overcome a 3–0 deficit twice.\n\nSuccessful comebacks\nBaseball\nBasketball\nIce hockey\nUnsuccessful comebacks\nBaseball\nIce hockey\n3–0-1 Comebacks in a best-of-seven with ties\nWhile ties can prolong the series to eight games or more, these are still best-of-seven series in that only seven of the games can have a decisive winner. Four victories still takes the series, thus overcoming a 3–0 deficit is still equally difficult.\n\nSee also\nList of teams that have overcome 3–1 series deficits\nList of teams that have overcome 2–0 series deficits in a best-of-five series\n\n\n== References ==",
    "List of teams that have overcome 3–1 series deficits": "The following is the list of teams that have overcome 3–1 series deficits mainly concerning North American professional sports within a best-of-seven series. The listed teams won three consecutive games after being down three games to one. Unsuccessful comebacks are also listed, in which teams evened a series after being behind 3–1, then lost the final game of the series.\nThe best-of-seven playoff structure is common in North American professional sports, particularly in the sports of baseball, basketball, and ice hockey. And prominently in three of the major North American professional sports leagues: Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, and the National Hockey League.\nThere are also some intermediate North American leagues below the major league level that use the best-of-seven format such as hockey's Calder Cup. The format is also used outside of North America, including the Taiwan Series baseball tournament, the final round of the Japan Series, the Chinese, Italian, Lithuanian, Polish, and Turkish baseball leagues, and later rounds of the Gagarin Cup of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) based in Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and China.\nAll 3–1 deficit comebacks in a seven-game series involve winning three straight elimination games, finally featuring a double-elimination game seven. Longer series of this nature are almost always structured as single-elimination knockout tournaments, so one more loss ends playoff contention for the losing side.\nThis is similar to a comeback from a 2–0 series deficit in a best-of-five series, which also requires winning three straight games.\nImplicit in overcoming a 3–1 series deficit are all teams who have overcome a 3–0 series deficit. These are noted in the series comment cells and—lacking an explicit column in the tabular format—can be identified with a \"3–0\".\n\nBackground\nThree major North American professional sports leagues have playoff series that can reach a seventh game: Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association (NBA), and the National Hockey League (NHL). In the history of these leagues, teams that were down 3–1 in a series have come back to win the series 58 times; 14 times in MLB, 13 times in the NBA, and 31 times in the NHL. The most recent instance was accomplished by the Florida Panthers of the NHL in the 2023 Stanley Cup Playoffs.\nThere have been three instances of a team coming back from a 3–1 deficit twice in the same postseason; occurring once in the MLB, NBA, and NHL. The most recent instance was by the Denver Nuggets in the 2020 NBA playoffs. The other two instances occured by the Kansas City Royals in the 1985 MLB postseason and the Minnesota Wild in the 2003 Stanley Cup playoffs.\nWithin the World Hockey Association and American Basketball Association, who each merged with the NHL and NBA, respectively, only one team came back from a 3–1 deficit: the Indiana Pacers came back to defeat the Kentucky Colonels in Eastern Division Semifinals of the 1969 ABA Playoffs.\n\nKey\nMajor League Baseball\nSuccessful comebacks\nMLB teams have overcome 3–1 deficits 14 times (including one 3–0 deficit), six of which occurred in the World Series. This does not count the 1903 World Series, during which the Boston Americans (or Puritans, or Pilgrims, depending on the source, and later known as the Red Sox) came back from a 3–1 deficit to defeat the Pittsburgh Pirates, five games to three, as that was a best-of-nine series.\n\nUnsuccessful comebacks\nSix other MLB teams have evened the series after being down 3–1 (including one down 3–0), only to lose game seven.\n\nNational Basketball Association\nSuccessful comebacks\nNBA teams have overcome 3–1 deficits 13 times, only one of which occurred in the NBA Finals. The NBA is the only major North American sport with seven-game playoff series where no team has overcome a 3–0 deficit.\n\nUnsuccessful comebacks\nNBA teams have overcome 3–1 deficits to force a seventh game 22 times, only to lose the series. In four of these instances, a team was down 3–0 in the series.\n\nNational Hockey League\nSuccessful comebacks\nNHL teams have overcome 3–1 deficits 32 times, the most recent instance being accomplished by the Florida Panthers during the 2023 Stanley Cup playoffs. The Rangers, the Vancouver Canucks, and the Montreal Canadiens are tied with the most successful 3–1 series comebacks in the NHL, with three. Four times a team comeback from 3–0 down and only one instance has occurred during the Stanley Cup Finals, accomplished in 1942 by the Toronto Maple Leafs, who initially trailed 3–0.\n\nUnsuccessful comebacks\nNHL teams have managed to force a seventh game while facing a 3–1 series deficit 33 times, only to lose the series in the seventh game subsequently. Six instances consisted of falling behind 3–0 in the series before losing in Game Seven.\n\nSee also\nList of teams that have overcome 3–0 series deficits\nList of teams that have overcome 2–0 series deficits in a best-of-five series\n\nNotes\n\n\n== References ==",

    "List of NBA single-game playoff scoring leaders": "This is a complete listing of National Basketball Association players who have scored 50 or more points in a playoff game. This feat has only been accomplished 50 times in NBA playoff history by 33 players. Only eight players have scored 50 or more points on more than one occasion: Michael Jordan (eight times), Wilt Chamberlain (four times), Allen Iverson (three times), Donovan Mitchell (three times), Jerry West (twice), Jamal Murray (twice), Damian Lillard (twice), and Jayson Tatum (twice). Rick Barry scored the last two of his three 50+ point playoff games in the American Basketball Association (ABA).\nOut of those 50 times, a player has earned himself a double-double (having double digits in two statistical categories) only 18 times; points and rebounds achieved 14 times, and points and assists the remaining 4 times. This feat has been achieved by 16 different players. In order of most points scored, these include Elgin Baylor, Wilt Chamberlain (4 times), Charles Barkley, Rick Barry, Damian Lillard, Jerry West, Nikola Jokić, Eric \"Sleepy\" Floyd, Jayson Tatum, Bob Pettit, Billy Cunningham, Bob McAdoo, Karl Malone, Dirk Nowitzki, Jamal Murray, and Giannis Antetokounmpo. Out of those 32 players, only 6 players have accomplished this feat while being born out of the United States: Dominique Wilkins (France), Dirk Nowitzki (Germany), Jamal Murray (Canada), Giannis Antetokounmpo (Greece), Nikola Jokić (Serbia), and Joel Embiid (Cameroon).\nThe only player to record a 50+ point triple-double in a playoff game is Russell Westbrook, who scored 51 points while grabbing 10 rebounds and dealing out 13 assists. The only players to score 50 or more points in a playoff game seven are Stephen Curry, who scored 50 points against the Sacramento Kings on April 30, 2023, and Jayson Tatum, who scored 51 points against the Philadelphia 76ers on May 14, 2023. Only two players scored 50 or more points in the same game. Donovan Mitchell of the Utah Jazz and Jamal Murray of the Denver Nuggets scored 51 and 50 points, respectively, on August 23, 2020. On August 30, 2020, Murray scored 50 points against the Utah Jazz, joining Mitchell as the first pair of players in NBA playoff history to record multiple 50-point games in the same series. Only four players have scored 50 or more points more than once in the same series: Michael Jordan (vs. Cleveland, 1988), Allen Iverson (vs. Toronto, 2001), Donovan Mitchell (vs. Denver, 2020), and Jamal Murray (vs. Utah, 2020).
