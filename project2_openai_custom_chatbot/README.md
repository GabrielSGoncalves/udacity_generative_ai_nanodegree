# Project 2: Building a Custom NBA Playoffs Chatbot <a class="jp-toc-ignore"></a>

## Project overview <a class="jp-toc-ignore"></a>
In this project, I've developed a custom chatbot focused on NBA playoffs information. By leveraging the Wikipedia API to gather comprehensive data about NBA playoffs history, statistics, and memorable moments, this chatbot serves as a specialized knowledge base for basketball enthusiasts, sports journalists, and casual fans looking for accurate playoff information.

The chatbot is built using OpenAI API and also information gathered from Wikipedia. So we are going to be able to test the relevance of using OpenAI to answered questions about NBA playoffs, and also compared the results when we combined Wikipedia information in our customized prompt to OpenAI.
Project structure

The current project is broken into the following parts:
Project Config

- Configuring OpenAO API
- Extracting data from Wikipedia
- Preparing the dataset
- Summarizing NBA Playoffs dataset
- Naive OpenAI NBA Playoffs Chatbot
- RAG Based OpenAI NBA Playoffs Chatbot

This NBA Playoffs Chatbot demonstrates how domain-specific knowledge can be integrated with large language models to create specialized AI assistants. By focusing exclusively on NBA playoffs data, the chatbot provides more detailed and accurate information than general-purpose AI systems when discussing this specific domain of basketball history.

The implementation showcases the power of customized knowledge bases prompts with language models to create a custom knowledge retrieval system without relying on complex frameworks, offering insights into the fundamental mechanics of modern AI assistants.
